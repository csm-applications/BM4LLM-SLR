      "Abstract": " X-ray computed tomography (CT) analysis is used to measure the heterogeneous fiber orientation fields in a 20 cm3 composite bracket made from prepreg platelet-based molding compound (PPMC). The as-molded mesostructure of the complete geometry is captured using material density gradients in 50 \u00b5m resolution CT scans without the need to resolve individual fibers. Fiber collimation and physical density gradients within intact platelets of this material system facilitates nondestructive assessment of average local fiber orientation at the component scale. Microscopy-based validation of the local orientation measurements indicate the accuracy that can be attained utilizing the density-based structure tensor CT analysis method. Local orientation field measurements for the complete geometry can be mapped into a \u201cdigital twin\u201d model, for purposes such as experimental performance simulation and validation of molding process orientation state predictions. Composite designers, analysts, and material suppliers can employ this methodology to more confidently utilize PPMCs and morphologically similar composite material systems.",

      "Title": "Digital twins in smart farming",
      "Abstract": " Digital Twins are very promising to bring smart farming to new levels of farming productivity and sustainability. A Digital Twin is a digital equivalent of a real-life object of which it mirrors its behaviour and states over its lifetime in a virtual space. Using Digital Twins as a central means for farm management enables the decoupling of physical flows from its planning and control. As a consequence, farmers can manage operations remotely based on (near) real-time digital information instead of having to rely on direct observation and manual tasks on-site. This allows them to act immediately in case of (expected) deviations and to simulate effects of interventions based on real-life data. This paper analyses how Digital Twins can advance smart farming. It defines the concept, develops a typology of different types of Digital Twins, and proposes a conceptual framework for designing and implementing Digital Twins. The framework comprises a control model based on a general systems approach and an implementation model for Digital Twin systems based on the Internet of Things\u2014Architecture (IoT-A), a reference architecture for IoT systems. The framework is applied to and validated in five smart farming use cases of the European IoF2020 project, focussing on arable farming, dairy farming, greenhouse horticulture, organic vegetable farming and livestock farming.",

      "Abstract": " Digital twin and physical internet adoption based on advanced digital technologies is gaining significance in the recent times. Digital twin is one of the enabling technologies that link actual physical system with its virtual depiction using advanced digital technologies. In order to leverage its potential, firms have instigated to adopt digital twin and physical internet for real-world applications. Although researches on impact of information technology in supply chains exists, a study on the modelling aspects by analysing critical success factors for adoption of digital twin and physical internet is limited. We have addressed this gap by developing a structural model for identifying the inter-relationships and cause effect parameters of critical success factors for adoption of digital twin and physical internet. Thirteen critical success factors were shortlisted based on literature review and in consultation with experts. An integrated Grey- based, decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)is used to visualize the causal relationships among critical success factors and verified by applying the proposed model in an electronics manufacturing firm. Sensitivity analysis has been done to check accuracy of results and robustness of the study. The results reveal that top management commitment and support and long, medium and short term planning are the most influential factors impacting the adoption of digital twin and physical internet in electronics industry. Findings of this research provide insights for supply chain managers and academicians by identifying the cause and effect group critical success factors for effective adoption of digital twin and physical internet.",

In this research, the digital twin of a gear measuring center (DTGMC) was constructed as an evaluation platform for various types of measurement software. Various digital workpieces instead of physical artifacts were measured on the DTGMC. Based on this platform, the evaluation methods for the measurement software were discussed, and three experiments were carried out. The involute measurement model was identified using multiple digital workpieces with known errors. The probe compensation algorithm was identified using different radii probes and a pin. Three position compensation algorithms were also verified using loading different motion errors. The results showed that the evaluation methods based on the DTGMC could effectively identify various errors in measurement software, providing a new concept for the independent evaluation of measurement software.",

As manufacturing activities become increasingly distributed while connected in the new era of manufacturing \u2013 Industry 4.0, energy-efficient manufacturing strategies and methodologies should be implemented in a global production network. The research work reported in this paper endeavors to develop a feasible solution to implementing energy-efficient manufacturing in such an environment by proposing a technical architecture, integrated with the developed platform, MCloud. The overall technical architecture is discussed in detail, particularly, the proposed Energy-efficient Manufacturing (E2M) module and two-round communication procedure. Feature-based technology was adopted in process planning to assess the technical capability and energy consumption of connected virtual factories. MCloud allows each party in this production network to use local energy consumption models for energy assessment with great flexitity and privacy protection.

      "Title": "Digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning of flow-type smart manufacturing systems",
      "Abstract": " The COVID-19 has become a global pandemic that dramatically impacted human lives and economic activities. Due to the high risk of getting affected in high-density population areas and the implementation of national emergency measures under the COVID-19 pandemic, both travel and transportation among cities become difficult for engineers and equipment. Consequently, the costly physical commissioning of a new manufacturing system is greatly hindered. As an emerging technology, digital twins can achieve semi-physical simulation to avoid the vast cost of physical commissioning of the manufacturing system. Therefore, this paper proposes a digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning (DT-RSPC) approach for open architecture flow-type smart manufacturing systems. A digital twin system is developed to enable the remote semi-physical commissioning. The proposed approach is validated through a case study of digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning of a smartphone assembly line. The results showed that combining the open architecture design paradigm with the proposed digital twins-based approach makes the commissioning of a new flow-type smart manufacturing system more sustainable.",

Deep integration between information and physical worlds is a key phase to develop smart assembly process design that bridge the gap between product assembly design and manufacturing. This paper presents a digital twin reference model for smart assembly process design, and proposes an application framework for DT-based smart assembly with three layers. Product assembly station components are detailed in the physical space layer; two main modules, communication connection and data processing, are introduced in the interaction layer; and we discuss working mechanisms of assembly process planning, simulation, predication, and control management in the virtual space layer in detail.

      "Abstract": " Battery management is critical to enhancing the safety, reliability, and performance of the battery systems. This paper presents a cloud battery management system for battery systems to improve the computational power and data storage capability by cloud computing. With the Internet of Things, all battery relevant data are measured and transmitted to the cloud seamlessly, building up the digital twin for the battery system, where battery diagnostic algorithms evaluate the data and open the window into battery's charge and aging level. The application of equivalent circuit models in the digital twin for battery systems is explored with the development of cloud-suited state-of-charge and state-of-health estimation approaches. The proposed state-of-charge estimation with an adaptive extended H-infinity filter is robust and accurate for both lithium-ion and lead-acid batteries, even with a significant initialization error. Furthermore, a state-of-health estimation algorithm with particle swarm optimization is innovatively exploited to monitor both capacity fade and power fade of the battery during aging. The functionalities and stability of both hardware and software of the cloud battery management system are validated with prototypes under field operation and experimental validation for both stationary and mobile applications.",

      "Title": "Digital twin-enabled Graduation Intelligent Manufacturing System for fixed-position assembly islands",
      "Abstract": " The layout of fixed-position assembly islands is widely used in the heavy equipment industry, where the product remains at one assembly island for its entire assembly period, while required workers, equipment, and materials are moved to the island according to the assembly plan. Such layout is not only suitable for producing bulky or fragile products, but also offers considerable flexibility and competitive operational efficiency for products with medium variety and volumes. However, due to inherent complexity of the product, sophisticated assembly operations heavily rely on skilled operators, and the complexity and uncertainty are high and amplified by such massive manual interventions as well as the unique routing patterns of the fixed-position assembly process. Aiming at reducing the complexity and uncertainty, this paper introduces a digital twin-enabled Graduation Intelligent Manufacturing System (DT-GiMS) for fixed-position assembly islands. Inspired by the success of graduation ceremony, an assembly system-Graduation Manufacturing System (GMS) is proposed for fixed-position assembly islands, in which job tickets, setup tickets, operation tickets, and logistics tickets are designed to organize the production activities. Following the concept of digital twin, unified digital representations with appropriate sets of information are created at object level, product level, and system level, respectively. Through Internet of Things (IoT), smart gateway, Web 3D and industrial wearable technologies, vital information including identity, status, geometric model, and production process can be captured and mapped in physical space, and converged and synchronized with their digital representations in twin (cloud) space on a real-time basis. The overall framework of DT-GiMS is presented with physical layer, digital layer, and service layer. Real-time convergence and synchronization among them ensure that right resources are allocated and utilized to the right activities at the right time with enhanced visibility. Considering customer demand and production capacity constraints, real-time ticket pool management mechanisms are proposed to manage production activities in a near-optimal way under DT-GiMS. With the support of cloud-based services provided in service layer in DT-GiMS, managers could easily make production decisions, and onsite operators could efficiently complete their daily tasks with nearly error-free operations with enhanced visibility. A demonstrative case is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed concept and approach.",

      "Abstract": " Increasing individualization demands in products call for high flexibility in the manufacturing systems to adapt changes. This paper proposes a novel digital twin-driven approach for rapid reconfiguration of automated manufacturing systems. The digital twin comprises two parts, the semi-physical simulation that maps data of the system and provides input data to the second part, which is optimization. The results of the optimization part are fed back to the semi-physical simulation for verification. Open-architecture machine tool (OAMT) is defined and developed as a new class of machine tools comprising a fixed standard platform and various individualized modules that can be added and rapidly swapped. Engineers can flexibly reconfigure the manufacturing system for catering to process planning by integrating personalized modules into its OAMTs. Key enabling techniques, including how to twin cyber and physical system and how to quickly bi-level program the production capacity and functionality of manufacturing systems to adapt rapid changes of products, are detailed. A physical implementation is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach to achieving improved system performance while minimizing the overheads of the reconfiguration process by automating and rapidly optimizing it.",

      "Title": "Construction method of shop-floor digital twin based on MBSE",
      "Abstract": " Digital twin (DT) technology is essential for achieving the fusion of virtual-real cyber-physical systems. Academics and companies have made great strides in the theoretical research and case studies of constructing the shop-floor digital twin (SDT), which is the premise of applying DT technology on the shop floor. A shop floor is a large complex system that involves many elements including people, machines, materials, methods, and the environment and processes, such as the technical flow, business process, logistics, and control flow. However, most of the developed cases lack a hierarchical, structured and modularized implementation framework for the development of an SDT system, which leads to problems such as a low reuse rate of the system blocks, lack of scalability, and high upgrade and maintenance costs. In response to these issues, we propose a construction method of the DT for the shop floor based on model-based systems engineering from the perspective of the system. In this method, a comprehensive DT model for the shop floor is gradually constructed by using system modeling language, the modeling method \u201cMagicGrid,\u201d and the \u201cV model\u201d of systems engineering. The model includes four dimensions of the shop-floor requirements, structure, behavior, and parameters, as well as three stages (the problem domain, solution domain, and implementation domain), and connects nine steps of the \u201cV model,\u201d including the system requirements, system architecture, subsystem implementation, subsystem integration, and system verification. Then, based on an example of a real NC machining shop floor, subsystems including a visualization system, synchronization system, and simulation system, are discussed. Finally, the functions of the integrated systems are verified based on the requirements, including the real-time synchronization of \u201cman, machine, material, and method\u201d and the transient simulation in real time. The numerical indicators of the integrated system are verified, including the model completeness and synchronization timeliness.",

      "Title": "Digital twin-based industrial cloud robotics: Framework control approach and implementation",
      "Abstract": " Industrial cloud robotics (ICR) integrates cloud computing with industrial robots (IRs). The capabilities of industrial robots can be encapsulated as cloud services and used for ubiquitous manufacturing. Currently, the digital models for process simulation, path simulation, etc. are encapsulated as cloud services. The digital models in the cloud may not reflect the real state of the physical robotic manufacturing systems due to inaccurate or delayed condition update and therefore result in inaccurate simulation and robotic control. Digital twin can be used to realize fine sensing control of the physical manufacturing systems by a combination of high-fidelity digital model and sensory data. In this paper, we propose a framework of digital twin-based industrial cloud robotics (DTICR) for industrial robotic control and its key methodologies. The DTICR is divided into physical IR, digital IR, robotic control services, and digital twin data. First, the robotic control capabilities are encapsulated as Robot Control as-a-Service (RCaaS) based on manufacturing features and feature-level robotic capability model. Then the available RCaaSs are ranked and parsed. After manufacturing process simulation with digital IR models, RCaaSs are mapped to physical robots for robotic control. The digital IR models are connected to the physical robots and updated by sensory data. A case is implemented to demonstrate the workflow of DTICR. The results show that DTICR is capable to synchronize and merge digital IRs and physical IRs effectively. The bidirectional interaction between digital IRs and physical IRs enables fine sensing control of IRs. The proposed DTICR is also flexible and extensible by using ontology models.",

      "Title": "Digital twin-based assembly data management and process traceability for complex products",
      "Abstract": " Complex products such as satellites, missiles, and aircraft typically have demanding requirements for dynamic data management and process traceability. The assembly process for these complex products involves high complexity, strong dynamics, many uncertainties, and frequent rework and repair, especially in the model development stage. Achieving assembly data management and process traceability for complex products has always been a challenge. A recently proposed solution involves one-to-one mapping of the corresponding physical entity, also known as the digital twin method. This paper proposes a digital twin-based assembly data management and process traceability approach for complex products. First, the dynamic evolutionary process of complex product assembly data was analyzed from three dimensions: granularity, period and version. Then, a framework of digital twin-based assembly data management and process traceability for complex products was constructed. Some core techniques are: 1) workflow-based product assembly data organization and version management; 2) synchronous modeling of the product assembly process based on digital twin; and 3) hierarchical management and traceability of product assembly data based on digital twin. On this basis, an algorithm flowchart for generating a product assembly data package was created, which includes product assembly data management, assembly process traceability, and generation of a product assembly data package. Furthermore, the Digital Twin-based Assembly Process Management and Control System (DT-APMCS) was designed to verify the efficiency of the proposed approach. Some aerospace-related assembly enterprises are currently using DT-APMCS and achieving satisfactory results. Finally, a summary of our work is given, and the future research work is also discussed.",

      "Title": "Bi-level dynamic scheduling architecture based on service unit digital twin agents",
      "Abstract": " Pure reactive scheduling is one of the core technologies to solve the complex dynamic disturbance factors in real-time. The emergence of CPS, digital twin, cloud computing, big data and other new technologies based on the industrial Internet enables information acquisition and pure reactive scheduling more practical to some extent. However, how to build a new architecture to solve the problems which traditional dynamic scheduling methods cannot solve becomes a new research challenge. Therefore, this paper designs a new bi-level distributed dynamic workshop scheduling architecture, which is based on the workshop digital twin scheduling agent and multiple service unit digital twin scheduling agents. Within this architecture, scheduling a physical workshop is decomposed to the whole workshop scheduling in the first level and its service unit scheduling in the second level. On the first level, the whole workshop scheduling is executed by its virtual workshop coordination (scheduling) agent embedded with the workshop digital twin consisting of multi-service unit digital twins. On the second level, each service unit scheduling coordinated by the first level scheduling is executed in a distributed way by the corresponding service unit scheduling agent associated with its service unit digital twin. The benefits of the new architecture include (1) if a dynamic scheduling only requires a single service unit scheduling, it will then be performed in the corresponding service unit scheduling without involving other service units, which will make the scheduling locally, simply and robustly. (2) when a dynamic scheduling requires changes in multiple service units in a coordinated way, the first level scheduling will be executed and then coordinate the second level service unit scheduling accordingly. This divide-and-then-conquer strategy will make the scheduling easier and practical. The proposed architecture has been tested to illustrate its feasibility and practicality.",

      "Abstract": " This paper presents a unified framework for the design and development of a passive biped robot and of its digital twin. A serial procedure is followed starting from the system's physical description, continuing to the dynamic analysis of independent models, and concluding with an experimental validation. The biped's mechanical model is tailored to preserve passive walker key functionalities without sacrificing design simplicity. The mechanical model gives rise to a mathematical model that describes the biped's gait, and to a multibody dynamics model of the biped. A passive biped robot prototype is developed based on the model. The prototype is equipped with a wireless sensor measuring system to enable data acquisition. The highlight of this work is the high degree of coincidence achieved between the passive response of the numerically simulated mathematical model, the response obtained by a multibody dynamics simulation, and the experimentally obtained response of the physical passive walking robot. This finding verifies the simulation methods used and encourages the use of a carefully designed digital twin in the design iterations involved in the development of walking robots.",

By leveraging means of data to simulate the behavior of physical entities in the real environment, the functions of physical entities can be optimized and expanded, through virtual and real interaction feedback, data fusion, decision making, and optimization. Despite numerous researches on digital twin concept and its applications, scarcely any discusses about the computation efficiency of the twin established. In order to shorten the latency of mapping and reduce the high computation workload in the cloud, this paper develops a cyber-physical machine tool based on edge computing techniques, to realize remote sensing, real-time monitoring and scalable high-performance digital twin application. Furthermore, a novel edge computing algorithm is proposed to detect the abnormality of the edge data from two aspects: the unary outliers of the edge data itself and the multivariate parameter correlation among edge devices. The effectiveness of the application platform of the cyber-physical machine tool developed is verified by the prototype system and edge algorithm experiment.",

      "Title": "Automated maintenance feasibility testing on the EU DEMO Automated Inspection and Maintenance Test Unit (AIM-TU)",
      "Abstract": " In order to reach commercially-relevant availability, future fusion power plants must minimise the duration of maintenance shutdowns. However, as radiation levels increase, so too will the number of maintenance tasks that must be performed without human access. To meet these conflicting constraints, remote maintenance systems must therefore significantly increase their capabilities, performing tasks faster and in parallel. Unfortunately, the current teleoperation-based maintenance approach is inherently limited in these regards. Automation emerges as a potential solution, having demonstrated dramatic productivity gains in manufacturing across the world. The European DEMO project has begun to explore the feasibility of automated maintenance as a route to meeting the challenging availability targets. To this end, the Automated Inspection and Maintenance Test Unit (AIM-TU) has been designed and constructed, providing a highly versatile test platform able to adapt to evolving R&D programmes. It consists of a modular robot cell equipped with two robot arms mounted on linear rails, interchangeable end-of-arm-tooling, a variety of vision sensors and a fully integrated safety system. The hardware is supported by a modular software architecture, which permits different control input modes and provides a digital twin simulation of the cell for virtual verification and validation of control algorithms. This paper provides an overview of the system's capabilities and reports on the first automated maintenance feasibility tests performed on the cell: automatic replacement of JET reactor tiles and automatic contactless inspection of tile anomalies.",

      "Title": "A proactive material handling method for CPS enabled shop-floor",
      "Abstract": " Cyber physical system (CPS) enables companies to keep high traceability and controllability in manufacturing for better quality and improved productivity. However, several challenges including excessively long waiting time and a serious waste of energy still exist on the shop-floor where limited buffer exists for each machine (e.g., shop-floor that manufactures large-size products). The production logistics tasks are released after work-in-processes (WIPs) are processed, and the machines will be occupied before trolleys arrival when using passive material handling strategy. To address this issue, a proactive material handling method for CPS enabled shop-floor (CPS-PMH) is proposed. Firstly, the manufacturing resources (machines and trolleys) are made smart by applying CPS technologies so that they are able to sense, act, interact and behave within a smart environment. Secondly, a shop-floor digital twin model is created, aiming to reflect their status just like real-life objects, and key production performance indicators can be analysed timely. Then, a time-weighted multiple linear regression method (TWMLR) is proposed to forecast the remaining processing time of WIPs. A proactive material handling model is designed to allocate smart trolleys optimally. Finally, a case study from Southern China is used to validate the proposed method and results show that the proposed CPS-PMH can largely reduce the total non-value-added energy consumption of manufacturing resources and optimize the routes of smart trolleys.",

      "Abstract": " Filling the gaps between virtual and physical systems will open new doors in Smart Manufacturing. This work proposes a data-driven approach to utilize digital transformation methods to automate smart manufacturing systems. This is fundamentally enabled by using a digital twin to represent manufacturing cells, simulate system behaviors, predict process faults, and adaptively control manipulated variables. First, the manufacturing cell is accommodated to environments such as computer-aided applications, industrial Product Lifecycle Management solutions, and control platforms for automation systems. Second, a network of interfaces between the environments is designed and implemented to enable communication between the digital world and physical manufacturing plant, so that near-synchronous controls can be achieved. Third, capabilities of some members in the family of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) are discussed with manufacturing features within the context of Smart Manufacturing. Trained results for Deep Q Learning algorithms are finally presented in this work as a case study to incorporate DRL-based artificial intelligence to the industrial control process. As a result, developed control methodology, named Digital Engine, is expected to acquire process knowledges, schedule manufacturing tasks, identify optimal actions, and demonstrate control robustness. The authors show that integrating a smart agent into the industrial platforms further expands the usage of the system-level digital twin, where intelligent control algorithms are trained and verified upfront before deployed to the physical world for implementation. Moreover, DRL approach to automated manufacturing control problems under facile optimization environments will be a novel combination between data science and manufacturing industries.",

This behavior model is continuously enriched by direct or derived learning, in order to improve the digital twin.

      "Abstract": " Smart manufacturing, as an emerging manufacturing paradigm, leverages massive in-context data from manufacturing systems for intelligent decision makings. In such context, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) play a key role in digitizing manufacturing systems and integrating multiple systems together for collaborative works. Amongst different levels of smartness and connectedness of CPS, Digital Twin (DT), as an exact digital copy of a physical object or system including its properties and relationship with the environment, has a significant impact on realizing smart manufacturing. A DT constantly synchronizes with its physical system and provides real-time high-fidelity simulations of the system and offers ubiquitous control over the system. Despite its great advantages, few works have been discussed about DT reference models, let alone a generic manner to establish it for smart manufacturing. Aiming to fill the gap, this research introduces a generic CPS system architecture for DT establishment in smart manufacturing with a novel tri-model-based approach (i.e. digital model, computational model and graph-based model) for product-level DT development. The tri-model works concurrently to simulate real-world physical behaviour and characteristics of the digital model. To validate the proposed architecture and approach, a case study of an open source 3D printer DT establishment is further conducted. Conclusions and future works are also highlighted to provide insightful knowledge to both academia and industries at last.",

      "Title": "A digital twin-driven hybrid approach for the prediction of performance degradation in transmission unit of CNC machine tool",
      "Abstract": " 2021Precision performance prediction of transmission system is considered as a key technology to modern equipment health management. Given the importance of maintaining a transmission system's precision, this paper presents a hybrid approach framework driven by digital twin technology (DT), to predict performance degradation. Firstly, a DT model based on meta-action theory is established, and real-time monitoring and digital simulation, driven by DT data, is realized in order to analyze the precision of the transmission units in machine tools. Secondly, the wear of gear in transmission unit is studied through Achard wear theory, which considered the comprehensive influence of gear load and speed on surface wear of the gear pair tooth, based on the model driving method. The performance degradation of the transmission unit is obtained by using the RBF neural network algorithm based on the data-driven method to extrapolate the wear data to the field-measurable precision index value. In addition, the hybrid predictive approach of the performance degradation model through the particle filter algorithm is built, and the real-time data is used to update the current state estimation to improve the prediction accuracy. By combining the mechanism of the physical degradation processes with the real-time and historical data and turning them into a cooperative architecture, this prediction method uses the complementary advantages offered by the fusion of these methods to bridge the link between data-driven prediction and model-based prediction. Finally, the method has been successfully applied to the precision prediction of the transmission unit in CNCMT turntable, and it is compared with the single prediction method to verify the effectiveness and feasibility.",

      "Title": "A flexible analytical model for operational investigation of solar hydrogen plants",
      "Abstract": " Hydrogen will become a dominant energy carrier in the future and the efficiency and lifetime cost of its production through water electrolysis is a major research focus. Alongside efforts to offer optimum solutions through plant design and sizing, it is also necessary to develop a flexible virtualised replica of renewable hydrogen plants, that not only models compatibility with the \u201cplug-and-play\u201d nature of many facilities, but that also identifies key elements for optimisation of system operation. This study presents a model for a renewable hydrogen production plant based on real-time historical and present-day datasets of PV connected to a virtualised grid-connected AC microgrid comprising different technologies of batteries, electrolysers, and fuel cells. Mathematical models for each technology were developed from chemical and physical metrics of the plant. The virtualised replica is the first step toward the implementation of a digital twin of the system, and accurate validation of the system behaviour when updated with real-time data. As a case study, a solar hydrogen pilot plant consisting of a 60 kW Solar PV, a 40 kW PEM electrolyser, a 15 kW LIB battery and a 5 kW PEM fuel cell were simulated and analysed. Two effective operational factors on the plant's performance are defined: (i) electrolyser power settings to determine appropriate hydrogen production over twilight periods and/or overnight and (ii) a user-defined minimum threshold for battery state of charge to prevent charge depletion overnight if the electrolyser load is higher than its capacity. The objective of this modelling is to maximise hydrogen yield while both loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and microgrid excess power are minimised. This analysis determined: (i) a hydrogen yield of 38\u201339% from solar DC energy to hydrogen energy produced, (ii) an LPSP <2.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 and (iii) < 2% renewable energy lost to the grid as excess electricity for the case study.",

      "Abstract": " A digital twin is a digital representation of a physical process, person, place, system or device. Digital twins were originally designed to improve manufacturing processes using simulations that have highly accurate models of individual components. However, with increasingly large and accurate building information models (BIM) combined with big data generated from IoT sensors in a smart city, it is now possible to create digital twin smart cities. An accurate 3D model of a city can be published online and walked around by the public to view proposed changes in urban planning and policy. This allows for easier dissemination and transparency to the public before putting these decisions into practice. This open and public model allows for an additional virtual feedback loop where citizens can interact and report feedback on planned changes in the city. Citizens can also interact with components to tag and report problems in their area. The digital twin also allows for additional experimentation where 3D data is necessary, such as flood evacuation planning. In this paper, we demonstrate a public and open digital twin of the Docklands area in Dublin, Ireland and show how this model can be used for urban planning of skylines and green space allowing users to interact and report feedback on planned changes.",

To demonstrate this concept, a physical manufacturing testbed was developed which bends metal into V-brackets alongside a digital twin counterpart consisting of the three elements. The process digital twin uses finite element modelling to predict product stress during the bending operation, and the residual stress and bend angle post-bending.

      "Title": "Transfer learning as an enabler of the intelligent digital twin",
      "Abstract": " 2021 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.Digital Twins have been described as beneficial in many areas, such as virtual commissioning, fault prediction or reconfiguration planning. Equipping Digital Twins with artificial intelligence functionalities can greatly expand those beneficial applications or open up altogether new areas of application, among them cross-phase industrial transfer learning. In the context of machine learning, transfer learning represents a set of approaches that enhance learning new tasks based upon previously acquired knowledge. Here, knowledge is transferred from one lifecycle phase to another in order to reduce the amount of data or time needed to train a machine learning algorithm. Looking at common challenges in developing and deploying industrial machinery with deep learning functionalities, embracing this concept would offer several advantages: Using an intelligent Digital Twin, learning algorithms can be designed, configured and tested in the design phase before the physical system exists and real data can be collected. Once real data becomes available, the algorithms must merely be fine-tuned, significantly speeding up commissioning and reducing the probability of costly modifications. Furthermore, using the Digital Twin's simulation capabilities virtually injecting rare faults in order to train an algorithm's response or using reinforcement learning, e.g. to teach a robot, become practically feasible. This article presents several cross-phase industrial transfer learning use cases utilizing intelligent Digital Twins. A real cyber physical production system consisting of an automated welding machine and an automated guided vehicle equipped with a robot arm is used to illustrate the respective benefits.",

      "Title": "A classification proposal of digital twin applications in the safety domain",
      "Abstract": " The increasing diffusion of digitalization in industry and society is forcing the adopting of tools based on new enabling technologies. This phenomenon is clearly observable in the manufacturing sector, where, due to the diffusion of Industry 4.0 paradigm, physical processes are integrating effectively with digital ones. One recent innovative technology is the Digital Twin (DT), where digital models and physical ones communicate \u2013 by sharing data as well as information \u2013 usually in a bidirectional way. As recent studies have analyzed the current level of adoption of DT technologies in the manufacturing sector, less effort has been focused on evaluating applications in the safety domain. Theoretically, the DT inherent capability of acquiring data from the physical world - usually developed in real time \u2013 together with the potentiality of reliable data processing could support a more effective diffusion of dynamic risk assessment models as well as real time alert management systems for improving safety. Otherwise, the actual capability of real applications highly depends on the level of complexity of the specific DT. The aim of the study is to provide a methodology to assess current application of DT technologies; the framework has been developed in the safety domain aiming to point out to researchers as well as technicians in a clear way the capabilities of a specific DT application. The framework has been adopted for analyzing current applications of DT in the scientific literature aiming to propose a theoretical validation. The application has outlined that, although the number of DT applications in the safety field is not so large, the current tools developed are characterized by a high level of complexity thus providing higher reliability to support the specific safety problem in analysis. Further developments will be oriented towards developing a quantitative assessment framework to integrate the proposed tool.",

      "Abstract": " 2019 Elsevier Inc.This paper employs a discrete damped dynamic system to investigate the emerging concept of a digital twin. Dynamic systems are well understood across engineering and science domains, and represent a familiar and convenient platform for exploring the various aspects of a digital twin design. The aim is to create a framework accessible to engineering sciences related to the aerospace, electrical, mechanical and computational area. The virtual model of the physical system is expressed as a differential equation in two-time scales, with the concept of a slow time being used to separate the evolution of the system properties from the instantaneous time. Cases involving stiffness variation and mass variation are considered, individually and together. It is assumed that the damped natural frequency and the time response are measured through sensors placed on the physical system. Issues of errors and reduced sampling rate in sensor measurements on the digital twin are investigated. The digital twin is expressed as an analytical solution through closed-form expressions and the effect of sensor errors is brought out through the simulations. Several key concepts introduced in this paper are summarized and ideas for urgent future research needs are proposed. The current work breaks free from the qualitative description of digital twins pervading the literature and can be used as benchmark solutions to validate digital twin of experimental dynamic systems and their implementation using sensors, the internet of things and deployment on the cloud computing systems.",

      "Title": "Transitioning from a meta-simulator to electrical applications: An architecture",
      "Abstract": " 2019 Elsevier B.V.Nowadays, simulators are used in different applications, such as benchmarking tools, for entertainment and educational purposes, to test scenarios that otherwise would not be possible to analyze (e.g., for security reasons) or to evaluate business and regulatory models. Nevertheless, simulators are usually tailor-made for a specific application. This paper proposes an original approach, an architecture for a software tool capable of simulating any electric power system application, the first energy-oriented meta-simulator. This tool would only require the definition of a set of behavior rules, easing the process of developing new simulators aimed at the energy sector. Its applications range from pure software simulators, that could be used with, for example, benchmarking, decision-making or competition purposes, to applications monitoring and controlling energy assets in real-time, such as hardware devices (e.g., sensors, actuators, or power plants) or digital twins. The proposed architecture resulted by studying previous tools and simulators with the objective of finding common blocks and elements to abstract them. For this reason, the proposed architecture intents to encompass any tool that aims to model the energy sector. Additionally, the proposed architecture is compliant with lightweight Internet of Things (IoT) protocols and smart systems and supports the synchronization with other frameworks at different levels.",

The FMS Training center phenomenon based learning environment consists of a physical training system and its digital twin. The realization of the digital twin is a virtual model linked to a system simulator and an industrial controller. Students can thus become familiar with the fully automated production system and develop and test programs in a virtual environment before visiting the production facility. The digital twin also meets an industrial need as it facilitates virtual commissioning of new system installations. Evaluation of the benefits in educational context, and the largest obstacles, of developing system level digital twins are described. A full system description of the learning environment is presented with the pedagogical objectives of the associated exercises.

This paper proposes a new production system control concept based on closing a feedback loop between a production planning system and a digital twin of the physical production system. The digital twin keeps up-to-date information about the current state of the physical production system and it is combined with the production planner utilizing artificial intelligence methods. Production recipes and concrete process instantiations are planned for each production order on-the-fly, based on the production system state retrieved form the digital twin. This approach provides a high flexibility in terms of ability to add and to remove products as well as production resources. It also enables error recovery by re-planning the production if some failure happens. The proposed approach is tested and evaluated on an internally hosted Industry 4.0 testbed, which confirms its efficiency and flexibility.",

      "Abstract": " 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier.Electric machines (e-machines) will form a fundamental part of the powertrain of the future. Automotive manufacturers are keen to develop e-machine manufacturing and assembly knowledge in-house. An on-going project, which aims to deliver an e-machine pilot assembly line, is being supported by a set of virtual engineering tools developed by the Automation Systems Group at the University of Warwick. Although digital models are a useful design aid providing visualization and simulation, the opportunity being exploited in this research paper is to have a common model throughout the lifecycle of both the manufacturing system and the product. The vision is to have a digital twin that is consistent with the real system and not just used in the early design and deployment phases. This concept, commonly referred to as Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), is key to realizing efficient system reconfigurability to support alternative product volumes and mixes. These tools produce modular digital models that can be rapidly modified preventing the simulation, test, and modification processes forming a bottleneck to the development lifecycles. In addition, they add value at more mature phases when, for example, a high volume line based on the pilot is created as the same models can be reused and modified as required. This research paper therefore demonstrates how the application of the virtual engineering tools support the development of a CPS using an e-machine assembly station as a case study. The main contribution of the work is to further validate the CPS philosophy by extending the concept into practical applications in pilot production systems with prototype products.",

This paper presents progress to date in developing a MBSE experimentation testbed that addresses these requirements. The current testbed comprises several compo-nents, including a scenario builder, a smart dashboard, a repository of system models and scenarios, connectors, optimization and learning algorithms, and simulation engines, all connected to a private cloud. The testbed has been successfully employed in developing an aircraft perimeter security system and an adaptive planning and decision-making system for autonomous vehicles. The testbed supports experimentation with simulated and physical sensors and with digital twins for verifying system behavior. A simulation-driven smart dashboard is used to visualize and conduct comparative evaluation of autonomous and human-in-the-loop control concepts and architectures.

      "Abstract": " 2019 Elsevier B.V.Long-lived, non-stop cyber-physical systems (CPS) are subject to evolutionary changes that can undermine the guarantees of schedulability that were verified at the time of deployment. At the same time, knowledge gleamed from extended periods of execution can be exploited to reduce the uncertainties that were inevitably presented in the system models that are used to define the temporal behaviours of the control tasks. In this paper we utilise this knowledge and present an adaptation method that actively extends the period of control tasks at run-time based on historical measurements. This can lead to lower power consumption or to the accommodation of increased computation resource demands from other components of the CPS. The method relies on online monitoring and model-based prediction to degrade control performance while having a minimal and acceptable impact on ongoing operations. Cloud-based computing is used to facilitate decision making and offload the local computation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method through control-scheduling co-simulation.",

      "Abstract": " 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.Modern technologies, such as cyber-physical systems and the digital twin, are driving current developments in digital production and its virtual planning tools. Thus leads to specific need for consistent methods that can be used across projects, especially on the future production planning\u2019s long term view. Existing approaches deal with the cross-sectoral, virtually supported integration of cyber-physical properties in production structures by using multiple software structures. However, the potential of current production-related simulation tools in the field of systems virtual validation in the planning phase has not yet been exhausted. Based on this, the present work deals with a method for model data enrichment within virtual model-based systems development process that is executed in front of systems\u2019 virtual commissioning. The elaborated method presupposes the successful procurement of the necessary CAD data as geometrical information and is divided into four steps, starting from the analysis of the process parameters on the basis of the product to be produced. In the second step, a property determination of the existing and planned production structure is carried out. In order to transfer the findings to the virtual modeling process, the third step is to determine the modeling needs between the current state of production and the planned cyber-physical production. Finally, a data enrichment of the products and resources behavioral models takes place that causes possibility of the mutual production-technical influence for example, by synchronizing the process structure that is stored in virtual products and resources. The method is to be classified as a total consideration of products, processes and resources in simulation-based functional verification and physical property validation. In addition, the four steps will be verified, by using the automated car-underbody assembly demonstrator for the physical relief of workers in the final assembly area of automobile production, including many variants.",

This issue can be resolved by supplementing the monitoring process with an additional diagnostics complex. This monitoring system receives data on the working processes of the vehicle automated systems' components in real time. An important difference from existing diagnostic systems is the ability to determine the exact malfunction of a vehicle's automated system component, as well as to establish the cause of the malfunction, allowing the system to reduce the possibility of a recurring malfunction and improve traffic safety. Coupled together with a data-sharing interface, this monitoring system enables the creation of the active vehicle's digital twin. We provide an example of how this simulation technology, based on a fusion of virtual and physical elements, helps study vehicle performance in complex, multi-factor operation modes. This diagnostic system, used in combination with a bench chassis model, makes it possible to adapt the system if the manufacturer adjusts the vehicle's automated system design, thereby simplifying the process of further verification of the digital twin. As automation grows more and more widespread, the use of such systems becomes more and more relevant.",

      "Title": "Methodology to develop Digital Twins for energy efficient customizable IoT-Products",
      "Abstract": " 2021 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.Products are increasingly individualized and enhanced to be able to communicate, e.g. via Industrial Internet of Things (IoT). However, the impact of products on sustainability (environmental and social) across their life is often not considered and analyzed. IoT-based or smart products, that are able to communicate, generate data, which can be used to monitor and optimize sustainability indicators. The Digital Twin (DT) is a new technological concept which focuses on product individual data collection and analysis. It provides the possibility to make use of the available data and optimize the systems individual sustainability as well as future product generations. However, the design and realization of such a DT requires new approaches and capabilities, which is an identified research gap. Therefore, this paper presents a methodology to develop DTs of physical IoT-based products, the so called DT V-Model with the aim to optimize the systems sustainability, specifically environmental aspects. It is based on the V-model for the development of smart products and is enhanced with additional roles and approaches for DT development. The methodology is described in detail. The result of a development cycle according to the DT-V-Model is a tested concept of a DT, which includes Digital Master (DM) data from the planning phase and Digital Shadow (DS) data from the production, operation and End of Life-phase. For a DT for energy efficiency, the Digital Master model consists of the information and models from the product development phase including the planned production and use phase energy consumption. The Digital Shadow consists of the actual production energy consumption and the use phase energy consumption. The methodology is applied to a use case of an IoT-based consumer product that can be customized to a certain degree by the consumer. A DT is developed to monitor and optimize the products energy efficiency in production and use. The necessary elements of the DT and the capabilities are depicted. The paper shows the feasibility of the methodology for the development of DTs, the necessary adaptions to common approaches for development and the specific characteristics of DT development for the aim of energy efficiency.",

      "Abstract": " 2020 The Society of Manufacturing EngineersIndustry 4.0-based manufacturing systems are equipped with Cyber-Physical Systems that are characterized by a strong interlinkage between the real world and the digital one: actions in one world have an impact on the other. In this paradigm, Digital Twins (DT) are defined as simulation models that are both getting data from the field and triggering actions on the physical equipment. However, most of the claimed DT in literature are only replicating the real system in a synchronized fashion, without feeding back actions on the control system of the equipment. In literature, these are referred to as Digital Shadows (DS). The paper proposes a way to integrate a DS simulation model with the Manufacturing Execution System (MES) in this way creating a DT. The MES-integrated DT is used for decision making thanks to the presence of an intelligence layer that hosts the rules and the knowledge to choose among alternatives. The paper proposes two frameworks based on the MES-integrated DT: one for managing error states and one for triggering disassembly processes as a consequence of low assembly quality. The DT simulation is developed and integrated with the MES of the Industry 4.0 Laboratory at the School of Management of Politecnico di Milano, where the proposed frameworks have been tested and validated.",

Digital twins represent real object together with their data and functions in the digital world. The latest developments in digital twin researches extend the application of following areas like simulation-based system engineering, simulation-based optimization and simulation-based control. Application of digital twin in plasma radiation detection gives a new opportunity to model the procedure of detection and discover the possible errors. This paper proposes a fuzzy based mathematical model of metal absorber\u2013metal resistor bolometer as a digital twin.

Our fuzzy based digital twin is tested on results of numerical plasma simulations the uncertainties (as a possible sources of detection error) of which are also handled via fuzzy logic. The resulted mathematical model (camera + plasma) is a suitable tool to be able to estimate the overall error and uncertainty of radiation detection.",

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0)Digital Twins (DTs for short) are a powerful aid for creating, assessing and maintaining control strategies. This use of DTs however requires that the physical entities to control be described at different levels of detail. For example, simple I/O models are used to compute parameters of modulating controllers, more time-accurate ones may be required to set up and assess logic controls, high-accuracy, possibly nonlinear ones may serve for overall strategy verification, and for software-in-the-loop testing, also the host computing/network architecture needs representing. In such a complex scenario, guaranteeing that all the descriptions of all elements are consistent with one another is a relevant problem. We discuss this matter and propose a solution, in the form of a modelling paradigm where - as a novel contributions - relationships (in a sense analogous to what the term means in database theory) can be instated and enforced. This allows to create and maintain knowledge based made of interrelate data and models, embracing all the major DT interpretations proposed so far in the literature, or said more explicitly, combining data-driven and model-driven DTs in a single framework. We also provide an illustrative example.",

Published by Elsevier B.V.The employment of intelligent tools in production, such as the new area of wearable robotics, the Exoskeletons, represents valuable and promising technology to reduce the physical stress and increase innovation, productivity and workplace safety. The challenge of realizing these advanced manufacturing environments with integrated Exoskeletons is represented by missing design and planning methods required to equip future workplaces with this enabling technology. The integration of Exoskeletons in logistics and production activities creates a new hybrid type of workstation that has to be designed according to a scientific approach. The article presents the first steps in developing an innovative approach to planning and optimizing intelligent working environments with integrated adaptive Exoskeletons. The topic harmonizes three main areas of research: a) production technologies and holistic planning of production processes; b) ergonomics, safety and security of workers in production environments and c) configuration based on the components of the new type of wearable robotics, the Exoskeletons. The validation of this approach is provided through the creation of digital human/Exoskeleton models combining digital Exoskeleton with various digital human models. The Digital Twin of the human/Exoskeleton system is the heart of a holistic design and optimization process that aims to assess the appropriateness of the selected Exoskeleton by simulating the tasks performed and adapting the simulation parameters. An exemplary validation case in one of the most innovative and dynamic sector, the construction sector, demonstrates the applicability of the model. A guideline for migrate the model in other industry sectors is provided, as well.",

      "Abstract": " 2021, The Author(s).This paper presents a novel method for rapidly addressing the earthquake-induced damage identification task in historic masonry towers. The proposed method, termed DORI, combines operational modal analysis (OMA), FE modeling, rapid surrogate modeling (SM) and non-linear Incremental dynamic analysis (IDA). While OMA-based Structural Health Monitoring methods using statistical pattern recognition are known to allow the detection of small structural damages due to earthquakes, even far-field ones of moderate intensity, the combination of SM and IDA-based methods for damage localization and quantification is here proposed. The monumental bell tower of the Basilica of San Pietro located in Perugia, Italy, is considered for the validation of the method. While being continuously monitored since 2014, the bell tower experienced the main shocks of the 2016 Central Italy seismic sequence and the on-site vibration-based monitoring system detected changes in global dynamic behavior after the earthquakes. In the paper, experimental vibration data (continuous and seismic records), FE models and surrogate models of the structure are used for post-earthquake damage localization and quantification exploiting an ideal subdivision of the structure into meaningful macroelements. Results of linear and non-linear numerical modeling (SM and IDA, respectively) are successfully combined to this aim and the continuous exchange of information between the physical reality (monitoring data) and the virtual models (FE models and surrogate models) effectively enforces the Digital Twin paradigm. The earthquake-induced damage identified by both data-driven and model-based strategies is finally confirmed by in-situ visual inspections.",

      "Title": "Digital twin physics-based model and machine learning applied to damage detection in structures",
      "Abstract": " This work is interested in digital twins, and the development of a simplified framework for them, in the context of dynamical systems. Digital twin is an ingenious concept that helps on organizing different areas of expertise aiming at supporting engineering decisions related to a specific asset; it articulates computational models, sensors, learning, real time analysis, diagnosis, prognosis, and so on. In this framework, and to leverage its capacity, we explore the integration of physics-based models with machine learning. A digital twin is constructed for a damaged structure, where a discrete physics-based computational model is employed to investigate several damage scenarios. A machine learning classifier, that serves as the digital twin, is trained with data taken from a stochastic computational model. This strategy allows the use of an interpretable model (physics-based) to build a fast digital twin (machine learning) that will be connected to the physical twin to support real time engineering decisions. Different classifiers (quadratic discriminant, support vector machines, etc) are tested, and different model parameters (number of sensors, level of noise, damage intensity, uncertainty, operational parameters, etc) are considered to construct datasets for the training. The accuracy of the digital twin depends on the scenario analyzed. Through the chosen application, we are able to emphasize each step of a digital twin construction, including the possibility of integrating physics-based models with machine learning. The different scenarios explored yield conclusions that might be helpful for a large range of applications.",

      "Title": "Cyber-physical-system for representing a robot end effector",
      "Abstract": " .Programming by Demonstration (PbD) is a method to program robots through the performance of a task by humans. Most implementations are online methods that use visual or force feedback of the demonstrator. However, we developed an offline programming approach for PbD with a special input device within an Augmented Reality Environment. Therefore, this paper aims to answer how the characteristics and functionality of the end effector of a jointed-arm robot can be represented by a haptic input device in order to perform PbD. The PbD process is first carried out on a digital twin of the robot, visualized to the user in real physical space by means of augmented reality technology. The programming of the digital twin can later be transferred to the real robot. The haptic input device in this context is the main part of the Cyber-Physical-System (CPS), which enables the user to interact with the virtual robot. Therefore, the specification of the mechanical and software components of the CPS is of main importance. Within this paper, strategies for the implementation of shape and function abstraction, as well as for ensuring communication, have been worked out. The physical shape of the CPS is kept generic and is only subject to ergonomic restrictions. However, Augmented Reality overlays the physical shape with an exact digital image of the end effector used later in the process. Nevertheless, the physical characteristics of the real robot should be represented as real as possible by the CPS. Therefore, the CPS is equipped with various sensors and actuators. With the CPS it is possible to determine contact forces and to manipulate objects to a certain extent in order to teach gripping strategies to the digital twin. An operating system was developed for communication and control of the electronic components. For the validation of the functionality of the CPS an exemplary PbD process was developed, the results were analyzed and evaluated.",

      "Abstract": " 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.The emergence of digital twin enables real-time interaction and integration between the physical world and the information world. Digital twin-based manufacturing systems, as a typical representative of smart manufacturing, have a set of advantages beyond the traditional ones, such as verifying and predicting the manufacturing system performance based on the operation of a virtual one. This paper presents a five-dimensional digital twin modeling approach for manufacturing systems, which can not only realize the mapping between the physical and virtual twins, but also some of the capabilities and dependencies of the digital twins can be derived. A reconfigurable strategy, based on the expandable model structure and the reserved interfaces of objective functions and optimization algorithms, is proposed to make the digital twin-based manufacturing system satisfy the various reconfigurable requirements of different granularities and targets. Finally, a prototype system is developed to demonstrate the performance of the reconfigurable digital twin-based manufacturing system, which can improve the operation efficiency of such systems for carrying out the reconfiguring production tasks.",

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0)The recent industrial scenario was defined by the emergence of digital twins and cyber physical systems as key elements for manufacturers leadership. Digital models can perform good in terms of production planning and control decisions if they are correctly representing their physical counterparts at anytime. Discrete event simulation can be considered as established digital models of manufacturing system, thanks to the proven capabilities of correctly estimating the system performances. Automated simulation model generation techniques can significantly reduce model development phases and allow for using simulation models for short term decisions in production. Application studies and test cases are scarce in the literature. In this paper, we present the application of a digital model generation method. The test case is done exploiting a lab-scale model of a manufacturing system composed by six stations. We investigate how the model generation works online, during the transient phase of a manufacturing system. Results confirm the real-time applicability of the approach provided that sufficient data points are available from the production event logs.",

      "Title": "A digital twin strategy for major failure detection in fused deposition modeling processes",
      "Abstract": " 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.Part distortion during additive manufacturing (AM) may lead to catastrophic failure and significant waste of resources. Existing work often focuses on identification and detection of individual root causes such as melt pool geometries or extruder clogging to prevent part failures. Since the end-effect of major print failures can be the result of multiple error sources (including unknowns), relying on detection of individual root causes may misclassify some failed prints as successful. Instead, detecting end-effects or part distortion could provide early warning of major failures regardless of potential error sources. Distortion detection, however, currently involves computationally expensive simulation and analysis of sensing data. One promising solution is to adopt digital twin strategy to quickly compare model prediction to features extracted from in situ sensing data. This study extends the digital twin strategy to major distortion detection by developing (1) a multi-view optical sensing system for movable print beds and (2) failure detection methods by analyzing multi-view of part images layer by layer. Since the digital twin of actual prints at specific layers are generated offline, delay can be reduced to determine if a significant enough quality departure has occurred to justify termination of the print. In the experimental evaluation of this approach for a FDM machine with a moving print bed, failure was rapidly detected in two of the three test prints, while in the remaining print, failure was successfully detected after a short delay.",

      "Abstract": " 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Coordinate metrology is a crucial part in advanced manufacturing industries to achieve and maintain conformance of high-quality products within design specifications. Meanwhile, software-components are increasingly becoming an essential part of the inspection process because of increasing part complexities in design and the high-volume of data captured from different sensors in hardware-components. This paper presents a virtual replica to work parallel to an integrated inspection system (IIS) for inspection of freeform and complex surfaces based on a metric of their geometric complexity. In this approach, an intelligently guided sampling is virtually conducted from a large dataset, instead of the physical sampling process when the sample points are traditionally selected randomly from the measured surface. Implementation of a closed-loop between the main tasks in IIS is considered in developing this digital twin to reduce the uncertainties associated with the inspection process. A method is introduced to estimate the local densities of the measured points required for virtual sampling from each patch on the work-pieces's surface based on its geometric complexity. Two case studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the methodology. The observed efficiency in selection of the important measured data in the proposed sampling strategy makes it a better sampling strategy to be implemented in a digital twin for IISs.",

In particular, the paper addresses the challenges from the easy availability of AI resources to be applied to drones that are already an asymmetric threat, and the issues concerning the Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS) that promise military advantages like the reduction of deployed soldiers, loss of civilians, damage of infrastructures, and the rapid support to decision-making. Autonomous systems can also help in disaster and humanitarian operations. However, the deployment of systems that are more and more autonomous from humans poses multidimensional challenges for their certification, compliance with ethics and international humanitarian law and present risks to security. Mechanisms for the mitigation of their proliferation to malicious non-state actors and a meaningful human control should be implemented. War gaming in a theoretical, risk-safe environment can assess the threats and impact of robotic weapons on future defense planning and operations. From the example of the lessons learned in the automotive industry, simulation can be applied to digital twin models of the AI system and the environment to train and test under unexpected and extreme conditions, unanticipated hardware and software failure situations and in complex dynamic operational contexts including interaction with civilian entities.",

However, the dynamic market changes and internal perturbations are characteristics that need to be handled by the ASRS control system to ensure the expected flexibility. The objective of this paper is two-fold. First, it proposes a framework of an ASRS control system, based on a hybrid control architecture that provides efficient operation during normal functioning and reactivity features in case of perturbations.

      "Abstract": " 2020, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.Nowadays, industrial robots could be a successful alternative to machine tools for milling of large parts with complex geometry. As it is known, poor accuracy which is most influenced by the stiffness of robot structure is recognized as a limiting factor for successful use of robots in milling tasks. Since there are different sources of error in robots, virtual manufacturing systems provide a useful means for products to be manufactured without the need of physical testing on the shop floor. This paper presents the developed virtual robot machining model, as a part of digital twin, for the simulation of a modified tool path generated by the compensation algorithm for the errors induced by cutting forces due to robot compliance. This part of digital twin includes the robot kinematic model, the Cartesian space robot compliance model, the model of cutting forces and the developed program based on off-line compensation algorithm. Development of such virtual robot machining model is important for the validation of modified tool path before the machining on a real robot. The developed virtual robot machining model is verified via several experiments, where the simulated surfaces are compared with the real machined surfaces generated by tool movement through a modified, i.e., corrected, trajectory on an available industrial robot programmed in G-code.",

      "Abstract": " 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Friction stir welding (FSW) is an innovative solid-state welding technology that produces high quality joints and is widely used in the aerospace industry. Previous studies have revealed welding temperature to be a decisive factor for joint quality. Consequently, several temperature control systems for FSW have been developed. These output feedback control systems usually require delicate and expensive temperature measuring equipment, which reduces their suitability for industrial practice. This paper presents a novel state feedback system of the welding temperature to remedy this shortcoming. The system uses a physical model of the FSW process (digital twin) for the determination of the welding temperature signal from the process torque signal. The digital twin is based on a multi-input nonlinear time invariant model, which is fed with the torque signal from the spindle motor. A model-based L1 adaptive controller was employed for its robustness with respect to model inaccuracies and fast adaption to fluctuations in the controlled system. The experimental validation of the feedback control system showed improved weld quality compared to welded joints produced without temperature control. The achieved control accuracies depended on the results of the temperature calculation. Control deviations of less than 10 K could be achieved for certain welding parameters, and even for a work piece geometry, which deliberately caused heat accumulation.",

      "Abstract": " 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Hyperconnectivity via modern Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has recently driven us to envision \u201cdigital twin\u201d, in which physical attributes are all embedded, and their latest updates are synchronized on digital spaces in a timely fashion. From the point of view of cyberphysical system (CPS) architectures, the goals of digital twin include providing common programming abstraction on the same level of databases, thereby facilitating seamless integration of real-world physical objects and digital assets at several different system layers. However, the inherent limitations of sampling and observing physical attributes often pose issues related to data uncertainty in practice. In this paper, we propose a learning-based data management scheme where the implementation is layered between sensors attached to physical attributes and domain-specific applications, thereby mitigating the data uncertainty between them. To do so, we present a sensor data management framework, namely D2WIN, which adopts reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to manage the data quality for CPS applications and autonomous systems. To deal with the scale issue incurred by many physical attributes and sensor streams when adopting RL, we propose an action embedding strategy that exploits their distance-based similarity in the physical space coordination. We introduce two embedding methods, i.e., a user-defined function and a generative model, for different conditions. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the D2WIN framework with the action embedding outperforms several known heuristics in terms of achievable data quality under certain resource restrictions. We also test the framework with an autonomous driving simulator, clearly showing its benefit. For example, with only 30% of updates selectively applied by the learned policy, the driving agent maintains its performance about 96.2%, as compared to the ideal condition with full updates.",

      "Abstract": " 2019 by the authors.This paper presents our approaches to chip level multi-domain LED (light emitting diode) modelling, targeting luminaire design in the Industry 4.0 era, to support virtual prototyping of LED luminaires through luminaire level multi-domain simulations. The primary goal of such virtual prototypes is to predict the light output characteristics of LED luminaires under different operating conditions. The key component in such digital twins of a luminaire is an appropriate multi-domain model for packaged LED devices that captures the electrical, thermal, and light output characteristics and their mutual dependence simultaneously and consistently. We developed two such models with this goal in mind that are presented in detail in this paper. The first model is a semi analytical, quasi black-box model that can be implemented on the basis of the built-in diode models of spice-like circuit simulators and a few added controlled sources. Our second presented model is derived from the physics of the operation of today's power LEDs realized with multiple quantum well heterojunction structures. Both models have been implemented in the form of visual basic macros as well as circuit models suitable for usual spice circuit simulators. The primary test bench for the two circuit models was an LTspice simulation environment. Then, to support the design of different demonstrator luminaires of the Delphi4LED project, a spreadsheet application was developed, which ensured seamless integration of the two models with additional models representing the LED chips' thermal environment in a luminaire. The usability of our proposed models is demonstrated by real design case studies during which simulated light output characteristics (such as hot lumens) were confirmed by luminaire level physical tests.",

      "Abstract": " 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Digital twins of measurement systems are used to estimate their measurement uncertainty. In the past, virtual coordinate measuring machines have been extensively researched. Research on digital twins of optical systems is still lacking due to the high number of error contributors. A method to describe a digital twin of an optical measurement system is presented in this article. The discussed optical system is a laser line scanner mounted on a coordinate measuring machine. Each component of the measurement system is mathematically described. The coordinate measuring machine focuses on the hardware errors and the laser line scanner determines the measurement error based on the scan depth, in\u2010plane angle and out\u2010of\u2010plane angle. The digital twin assumes stable measurement conditions and uniform surface characteristics. Based on the Monte Carlo principle, virtual measurements can be used to determine the measurement uncertainty. This is demonstrated by validating the digital twin on a set of calibrated ring gauges. Two validation tests are performed: the first verifies the virtual uncertainty estimation by comparison with experimental data. The second validates the measured diameter of different ring gauges by comparing the estimated confidence interval with the calibrated diameter.",

      "Title": "Preparing Datasets of Surface Roughness for Constructing Big Data from the Context of Smart Manufacturing and Cognitive Computing",
      "Abstract": " 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In smart manufacturing, human-cyber-physical systems host digital twins and IoT-based net-works. The networks weave manufacturing enablers such as CNC machine tools, robots, CAD/CAM systems, process planning systems, enterprise resource planning systems, and human resources. The twins work as the brains of the enablers; that is, the twins supply the required knowledge and help enablers solve problems autonomously in real-time. Since surface roughness is a major concern of all manufacturing processes, twins to solve surface roughness-relevant problems are needed. The twins must machine-learn the required knowledge from the relevant datasets available in big data. Therefore, preparing surface roughness-relevant datasets to be included in the human-cyber-physical system-friendly big data is a critical issue. However, preparing such datasets is a challenge due to the lack of a steadfast procedure. This study sheds some light on this issue. A state-of-the-art method is proposed to prepare the said datasets for surface roughness, wherein each dataset consists of four segments: semantic annotation, roughness model, simulation algorithm, and simulation system. These segments provide input information for digital twins\u2019 input, modeling, simulation, and validation modules. The semantic annotation segment boils down to a concept map. A human-and machine-readable concept map is thus developed where the information of other segments (roughness model, simulation algorithm, and simulation system) is integrated. The delay map of surface roughness profile heights plays a pivotal role in the proposed dataset preparation method. The successful preparation of datasets of surface roughness underlying milling, turning, grinding, electric discharge machining, and polishing shows the efficacy of the proposed method. The method will be extended to the manufacturing processes in the next phase of this study.",

      "Abstract": " 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.A digital twin can be described as a digital replica of a physical asset. The use of such models is key to understanding complex loading phenomena experienced during testing of vertical axis wind turbines. Unsteady aerodynamic and structural effects such as dynamic stall and dynamically changing thrust and blade loading are difficult to predict with certainty. This leads to inefficient turbine designs or worse yet premature failures. Many of these phenomena can be better understood through scaled wind tunnel testing. The analysis of these test results is greatly improved by having a well calibrated digital twin model of the turbine. This paper discusses the methodologies used in the development of the model for a H style vertical axis wind turbine. This includes physical measurements of the as built system, updates to the models based upon experimental testing and a final correlation between test and model on a component by component as well as fully assembled system.",

      "Abstract": " 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The paper deals with development of a methodology for mechatronic system design using state-of-the-art model-based system engineering methods. A simple flexible robotic arm is considered as a benchmark problem for the evaluation of various techniques used in the phases of modelling, analysis, control system design, validation, and implementation. The flexible nature of the mechanical structure introduces inherently oscillatory dynamics in the target bandwidth range, which complicates all the above-mentioned design steps. This paper demonstrates the process of deriving a complex nonlinear model of the flexible arm setup. An initial idea about the plant dynamics is acquired from analytical modelling using the Euler\u2013Bernoulli beam theory. A more thorough understanding is subsequently acquired from finite element analysis. Linearisation and order reduction are the next steps necessary for the derivation of a simplified control-relevant model. A time-dependent variable parameter of load mass position is considered and a robust controller is subsequently designed in order to fulfil certain performance criteria for all the admissible plant configurations. This is performed using a recent H-infinity loop shaping method for fixed structure controller design. The results are validated by means of a physical plant, comparing the experimental data with the model predictions.",

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).Industry 4.0 requires phenomenon twins to functionalize the relevant systems (e.g., cyber-physical systems). A phenomenon twin means a computable virtual abstraction of a real phenomenon. In order to systematize the construction process of a phenomenon twin, this study proposes a system defined as the phenomenon twin construction system. It consists of three components, namely the input, processing, and output components. Among these components, the processing component is the most critical one that digitally models, simulates, and validates a given phenomenon extracting information from the input component. What kind of modeling, simulation, and validation approaches should be used while constructing the processing component for a given phenomenon is a research question. This study answers this question using the case of surface roughness-a complex phenomenon associated with all material removal processes. Accordingly, this study shows that for modeling the surface roughness of a machined surface, the approach called semantic modeling is more effective than the conventional approach called the Markov chain. It is also found that to validate whether or not a simulated surface roughness resembles the expected roughness, the outcomes of the possibility distribution-based computing and DNA-based computing are more effective than the outcomes of a conventional computing wherein the arithmetic mean height of surface roughness is calculated. Thus, apart from the conventional computing approaches, the leading edge computational intelligence-based approaches can digitize manufacturing processes more effectively.",

To solve many difficult problems related to human-vehicle-road perception, decision, control coordination, and reliability evaluation in the intelligent networked scenario, this study establishes a dynamic Game model with multi-source information in the intelligent networked environment, to carry out the measurements and control evaluations for autonomous vehicle dynamics models, forward and backward active safety control, and mixed traffic trajectory optimization planning based on the optimal solution strategy. A digital twin test verification platform with semi-physical environment and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation to control the accuracy for making dynamic safety decision for the intelligent networked vehicle is developed by combining with the V2X real intelligent transportation system and smart laboratory virtual simulation test technology, which realizes the complex and dynamic safety decision goals for autonomous vehicle in different connected levels of the mixed-flow traffic environments, such as multi-agent perception, multi-source information transmission, vehicle control, vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and vehicle-to-road coordination. The study is conducive to improving the test efficiency and index evaluation integrity of the intelligent networked system, reducing the test costs, proving the behaviors of Game interaction and stress safety response under vehicle-to-road environment, enhancing the robustness and applicability of automatic driving technology, and improving the traffic efficiency and safety of mixed-flow traffic in the intelligent network.",

      "Abstract": " Artificial Intelligence (AI) is escalating in data-driven condition monitoring research. Traditional expert knowledgebased Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) processes can be smartened up with the assistance of various AI techniques, such as deep learning models. On the other hand, current deep learning based prognostics suffers from the data deficit issue, especially considering the varying operating conditions and the degradation modes of the components in practical industrial applications. With the development of simulation techniques, physical-knowledge based digital twin models give engineers access to a large amount of simulation data at a lower cost. These simulation data contain the physical characteristics and the degradation information of the component. In order to accurately predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) during the degradation process, in this paper, a bearing digital twin model is constructed based on a phenomenological vibration model. A Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) is used to achieve the domain adaptation target between the simulation and the real data. Regarding the simulation data as the source domain and the real data as the target domain, the DANN model is able to predict the RUL without any priori knowledge of the labelling information. Based on the validation results from real bearing run-to-failure experiments, the proposed method is able to get the minimum RUL prediction error compared against state-of-the-art methods.",

Based on the hybrid modeling approach combining mechanistic and data-driven technologies, the DT model of a solar car is established with a designed cloud platform server based on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to realize data interaction between physical and virtual entities. The DT model is further modified by the offline optimization data of drive motors, and the energy consumption is evaluated with the DT system in the real-world experiment. Specifically, the energy consumption error between the experiment and simulation is less than 5.17%, which suggests that the established DT model can accurately stimulate energy consumption.

      "Abstract": " 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.This paper deals with the design and implementation of a universal cyber-physical model capable of simulating any production process in order to optimize its logistics systems. The basic idea is the direct possibility of testing and debugging advanced logistics algorithms using a digital twin outside the production line. Since the digital twin requires a physical connection to a real line for its operation, this connection is substituted by a modular cyber-physical system (CPS), which replicates the same physical inputs and outputs as a real production line. Especially in fully functional production facilities, there is a trend towards optimizing logistics systems in order to increase efficiency and reduce idle time. Virtualization techniques in the form of a digital twin are standardly used for this purpose. The possibility of an initial test of the physical implementation of proposed optimization changes before they are fully implemented into operation is a pragmatic question that still resonates on the production side. Such concerns are justified because the proposed changes in the optimization of production logistics based on simulations from a digital twin tend to be initially costly and affect the existing functional production infrastructure. Therefore, we created a universal CPS based on requirements from our cooperating manufacturing companies. The model fully physically reproduces the real conditions of simulated production and verifies in advance the quality of proposed optimization changes virtually by the digital twin. Optimization costs are also significantly reduced, as it is not necessary to verify the optimization impact directly in production, but only in the physical model. To demonstrate the versatility of deployment, we chose a configuration simulating a robotic assembly workplace and its logistics.",

Although quite a few theoretical unified data models of BIM and GIS integration have been presented in precedent research, the practical web-based applications and software support for real-world city information modeling are still difficult to achieve. One of the challenges is storage inefficiency. It thence leads to burdens in exchange and analysis, which hugely impede the realization of virtual-real fusion. To address that issue, in this research, we contribute to exploring an HDF- (Hierarchical Data Format-) based, innovative, and synthesized scheme with three significant technical processes. First, data reorganization trims the original data with efficient redundancy elimination and reordering for IFC-SPF (IFC STEP Physical File) and XML-encoded CityGML (City Geography Markup Language). Next, bidirectional transformation methods for BIM and GIS modeling data, images, and analytical data into HDF are proposed. They retain the entities and relationships in modeling data and can further improve the compactness and accessibility by ultimately 60%-80% which saves 497,612 KB from 565,152 KB in the test of ZhongChun transformation substation. Finally, data aggregation enhances the bond of the integrated model and heterogeneous data resources from the transformed HDF files. The case studies show that the approach proposed in this paper could reach high efficiency for practicability of the BIM + GIS integration model. This light-weight integration method can further improve the front-end service responsiveness in digital twin applications.",

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).The design and development of composite structures requires precise and robust manufacturing processes. Composite materials such as fiber reinforced thermoplastics (FRTP) provide a good balance between manufacturing time, mechanical performance and weight. In this contribution, we investigate the process combination of thermoforming FRTP sheets (organo sheets) and injection overmolding of short FRTP for automotive structures. The limiting factor in those structures is the bond strength between the organo sheet and the overmolded thermoplastic. Within this process chain, even small deviations of the process settings (e.g., temperature) can lead to significant defects in the structure. A cyber physical production system based framework for a digital twin combining simulation and machine learning is presented. Based on parametric Finite-Element-Method (FEM) studies, training data for machine learning methods are generated and a FEM surrogate is developed. A comparison of different data-driven methods yields information on the estimation accuracy of task-specific data-driven methods. Finally, in accordance with experimental cross tension tests, the investigated FEM surrogate model is able to predict the interface bond strength quality in dependence of the process settings. The visualization into different quality domains qualifies the presented approach as decision support.",

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.This paper is concerned with the implementation and field-testing of an edge device for real-time condition monitoring and fault detection for large-scale rotating equipment in the UK water industry. The edge device implements a local digital twin, processing information from low-cost transducers mounted on the equipment in real-time. Condition monitoring is achieved with sliding-mode observers employed as soft sensors to estimate critical internal pump parameters to help detect equipment weasr before damage occurs. The paper describes the implementation of the edge system on a prototype microcontroller-based embedded platform, which supports the Modbus protocol; IP/GSM communication gateways provide remote connectivity to the network core, allowing further detailed analytics for predictive maintenance to take place. The paper first describes validation testing of the edge device using Hardware-In-The-Loop techniques, followed by trials on large-scale pumping equipment in the field.

      "Title": "Concept and case study for a generic simulation as a digital shadow to be used for production optimisation",
      "Abstract": " 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Optimising an existing production plant is a challenging task for companies. Necessary physical test runs disturb running production processes. Simulation models are one opportunity to limit these physical test runs. This is particularly important since today\u2019s fast and intelligent networking opportunities in production systems are in line with the call of Industry 4.0 for substantial and frequent changes. Creating simulation models for those systems requires high effort and in-depth knowledge of production processes. In the current literature, digital twins promise several advantages for production optimisation and can be used to simulate production systems, which reduce necessary physical test runs and related costs. While most companies are not able to create digital twins yet, companies using enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have the general capability to create digital shadows. This paper presents a concept and a case study for a generic simulation of production systems in AnyLogic\u2122 to create digital shadows as the first step towards a full digital twin. The generic simulation visualises production systems automatically and displays key performance indicators (KPIs) for the planned production program, using representational state transfer (REST) interfaces to extract product and production data from an ERP system. The case study has been applied in a learning factory of the University of Applied Life Sciences Emden/Leer. The results prove the presented concept of the generic simulation and show the limits and challenges of working with generic simulation models.",

      "Abstract": " 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.This paper presents a hardware testbed that furthers the development of a dynamic data-driven application system (DDDAS). In particular, the focus of this testbed is on enabling a self-aware unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Self-awareness in this context refers to the ability of the vehicle to collect information about itself and use this information to alter the way it completes missions via on-board dynamic decision-making. Prior work has focused on developing computational methods that enable a digital twin of this vehicle, and demonstration of the resulting self-aware capability via simulation. This work presents a hardware testbed and associated experimental methodology for data collection, analysis, and demonstration of the self-aware UAV concept. The hardware testbed includes custom-built carbon fiber wings, the design of which have been validated via flight test. A sensor suite composed of wireless high frequency dynamic strain sensors has been developed and demonstrated using benchtop experiments. The proposed DDDAS architecture, which includes previously developed computational methods, has the potential to enable two-way coupling between estimation of the UAV structural state and dynamic mission replanning; capability that is critical for realizing the self-aware UAV concept.",

      "Title": "An approach for adaptive model performance validation within digital twinning",
      "Abstract": " 2021 WIT Press.The validation of the operationality of models is considered a crucial step in the model development process. Recent developments in Digital Twinning (DT) enable the online availability of operational data from the physical asset required for operational validation. The benefits of DT in situations where operational validation has formed a basis for model adaptation has also been demonstrated. However, these benefits within DT have not been fully utilized due to the lack of an approach for benchmarking the required quantity, quality and diversity of validation data and performance metrics for online model validation and adaptation. Therefore, there is a need for a framework for benchmarking validation data and metrics requirements during model validation in different domains. An approach for benchmarking the required quantity, quality and variability of validation data and performance metric(s) for online model adaptation within DT is proposed. The approach is focused on addressing the problem of parameter(s) uncertainty of a predictive model within its uncertainty boundary. It involves generating virtual test models, a primary and another reference model for the performance evaluation of one compared to the another with the benchmarked validating data and metrics within DT. This process is repeated until the dataset and/or metric(s) are promising enough to validate primary model against the reference model. The proposed approach is demonstrated using BEASY - a simulator designed to predict protection provided by a cathodic protection system to an asset. In this case, a marine structure is the focus of the study, where the protection potentials to prevent corrosion are predicted over the life of the structure. The algorithm(s) for the approach are provided within a Scientific Software (MATLAB) and integrated to the simulator-based cathodic-protection model.",

      "Title": "The investigation of dynamic properties of 3D-printed steel parts",
      "Abstract": " 2021, ITMO University. All rights reserved.Additive technologies are promising for manufacturing parts of metal navigation devices with complex shapes. Finite element analysis is used during the designing of such items. The modeling accuracy is determined by the correctness of the specified physical properties of materials. The properties of materials used in 3D printing significantly differ from the ones used in the traditional manufacturing. Researchers focus on such characteristics as Young\u2019s modulus, Poisson\u2019s ratio, hardness and strength. Meanwhile, some applications require dynamic properties. The paper presents the investigation and comparison of damping properties of three steel parts produced by different methods. The first part is manufactured by 3D printing with melting in the transverse direction, and the second part is done by melting in the longitudinal direction, while the third one is traditionally manufactured. The parts are shaft shaped with constant cross-section and have the same geometric dimensions. The TIRA TV 5220 / LS-120 stand is used. A piezoelectric accelerometer is installed at the loose end of the part. The tests are carried out in the frequency range from 15 to 3500 Hz and with an acceleration of 19.6 m/s2 (2 g). The accelerometer output is used to calculate the damping coefficient. The results are verified by comparison with the finite element modeling results. The damping coefficients of transverse and longitudinal 3D-printed parts are 0.022 and 0.006, respectively. The damping coefficient of the traditional manufactured part is 0.023. The difference of 3D-printed parts damping coefficients can be explained by the denser fusion of powder granules when printing one layer than between layers. In this case, a crystal structure with greater rigidity in the printing plane is formed and it limits the dissipation of vibrati on energy due to internal friction. Finite element modeling shows mismatch between the experimental and calculated values of the printed parts natural frequencies. Considering that the values of natural frequencies are largely determined by Young\u2019s modulus, a parametric optimization of its value is carried out. It was found that the value of Young\u2019s modulus does not correspond to the values determined during tensile tests for similar samples. Thus, 3D-printed parts have different vibration and static stiffness. This is not typical for metals and should be taken into account in simulations. The research results can be used in the simulation model development of steel 3D-printed parts and in the design of digital twins for navigation devices. It allows one to estimate vibration resistance of promising products at the early stages of their design and to optimize the construction minimizing stress.",

      "Abstract": " 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are complex physical systems interacting with a considerable number of distributed computing elements for monitoring, control and management. They are currently becoming larger as Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems (CPSoS), since many industrial companies are transitioning their complex systems of systems to software-intensive solutions in different domains such as production or manufacturing. Following the development and dissemination of DevOps approaches in the Software Engineering world, we propose the Twin-Driven Engineering (TDE) paradigm as a way to upgrade the role of Digital Twins (DT) to become a central point in all the engineering activities on the CPSoS, from design to decommissioning. Since CPSoS can be highly heterogeneous, we rather target the support for producing and maintaining a single integrated virtual representation of the CPSoS (i.e. a System of Twins) on which it is possible to perform global reasoning, analysis and verification. However, such a new paradigm comes with several open research challenges. We provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in key areas related to TDE. We identify under-investigated problems in related work and outline corresponding research directions.",

      "Abstract": " 2020 R.-P. Nikula et al., published by De Gruyter 2020.Digital twins have gained a lot of attention in modern day industry, but practical challenges arise from the requirement of continuous and real-time data integration. The actual physical systems are also exposed to disturbances unknown to the real-time simulation. Therefore, adaptation is required to ensure reliable performance and to improve the usability of digital twins in monitoring and diagnostics. This study proposes a general approach to the real-time adaptation of digital twins based on a mechanism guided by evolutionary optimization. The mechanism evaluates the deviation between the measured state of the real system and the estimated state provided by the model under adaptation. The deviation is minimized by adapting the model input based on the differential evolution algorithm. To test the mechanism, the measured data were generated via simulations based on a physical model of the real system. The estimated data were generated by a surrogate model, namely a simplified version of the physical model. A case study is presented where the adaptation mechanism is applied on the digital twin of a marine thruster. Satisfactory accuracy was achieved in the optimization during continuous adaptation. However, further research is required on the algorithms and hardware to reach the real-time computation requirement.",

The platform can real-time monitor of the physical workshop and track orders, products, equipment and other information. Further, the platform and visualization technology were explored to work together. Then, the true display of changes after production line decision was displayed. It enables managers to carry out production scheduling verification in the virtual workshop, which reduces the repeated changes of physical workshop production scheduling. Finally, the platform was verified in a discrete manufacturing workshop. The scheduling platform based on digital twins helps manager to immersivity develop factory production strategies. The production efficiency was then enhanced. The platform can ensure the effective operation of the manufacturing system.",

      "Abstract": " 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.There is an industry wide push for faster and more feature rich systems, also in the development of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Therefore, the need for applying agile development practices in the model-based design of CPS is becoming more widespread. This is no easy feat, as CPS are inherently complex, and their model-based development is less suited for agile development. Model-based development does suit the concept of digital twin, that is, design models representing a system instance in operation. In this paper we present an approach where the digital twins of system instances serve as a common-knowledge base for the entire agile development cycle of the system when performing system updates. Doing so enables interesting possibilities, such as the identification and detection of system variants, which is beneficial for the verification and validation of the system update. It also brings along challenges, as the executable physics based digital twin is generally computationally expensive. In this paper we introduce this approach by means of a small example of a swiveling pick and place robotic arm. We also elaborate on related work, and open future challenges.",

The software includes submodels for determining the main engine parts wear rate and allows to predict engine parts life time, to simulate normal and accelerated engine reliability and durability tests. In the course of the study, the well-known model for determining mechanical frictional losses SLM (Shayler, Leong, Murphy, 2005) was adapted to calculate the relative change in the wear rate of engine parts. Universal equations are obtained to determine the friction forces as applied to rotationally and reciprocally moving engine parts.

      "Title": "Mixed-reality automotive testing with sensoris",
      "Abstract": " 2020 Budapest University of Technology and Economics. All rights reserved.Highly automated and autonomous vehicles become more and more widespread changing the classical way of testing and validation. Traditionally, the automotive industry has pursued testing rather in real-world or in pure virtual simulation environments. As a new possibility, mixed-reality testing has also appeared enabling an efficient combination of real and simulated elements of testing. Furthermore, vehicles from different OEMs will have a common interface to communicate with a test system. The paper presents a mixed-reality test framework for visualizing perception sensor feeds real-time in the Unity 3D game engine. Thereby, the digital twin of the tested vehicle and its environment are realized in the simulation. The communication between the sensors of the tested vehicle and the central computer running the test is realized via the standard SENSORIS interface. The paper outlines the hardware and software requirements towards such a system in detail. To show the viability of the system a vehicle in the loop test has been carried out.",

      "Title": "Model improvement with experimental design for identifying error sources in a computational model",
      "Abstract": " 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Optimization-based model improvement has been introduced as a strategy to enhance the prediction ability of a computational model. It involves model calibration, model validation, and model refinement. Model calibration estimates the optimal value of unknown parameters. Model validation determines the validity of a computational model, and model refinement enhances a model to improve its accuracy. In model improvement, a variety of sources of errors in the observation and prediction can interrupt the model improvement process. The error sources degrade the parameter estimation accuracy in model calibration. When a computational model turns out to be invalid because of these error sources, model refinement is required. However, since model validation cannot distinguish between parameter estimation errors and modeling errors, the existing method is difficult to refine the computational model efficiently. Thus, this study aims to develop a model improvement process that identifies the leading cause of invalidity of a prediction. In this work, an experimental design method is integrated with optimization-based model improvement to minimize the effect of estimation errors in model calibration. Through use of the proposed method, after calibration, the computational model mainly includes the effect of unrecognized modeling errors. Two case studies are provided to confirm the efficacy of the proposed method: an analytical beam study and automotive wheel rim analysis.",

      "Abstract": " 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.This paper details the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) components of an Intelligent Digital Twin (IDT) system for a semiconductor manufacturing company using gamming visual effects, 3D Computer Aided Design (CAD) and sound effects. The designed digital twin (DT) system will allow users to detect any irregularities (such as equipment failures and defects) in the manufacturing processes, in a timely manner and test some changes without an actual touching of the physical components. The project aims to design an IDT system that enhances the user\u2019s interaction by visualizing big data in such a way which can be easily understood and processed. Thus, allowing the user to intervene and control the entire production processes from the virtual console. The designed IDT system will enhance the UX of the system through the use of new interaction methodologies. The user will have full control of the data flow which is flowing from a data lake through for example, a gazing, a gesturing and a voice recognition interface which will provide contextual information based upon the user\u2019s viewpoint. The current phase of the project investigates the use of Cave VR technology to improve the immersion and the interaction between the user and the virtual system. We seek to develop a virtual environment that makes the users feel they are naturally interacting in a visually-immersed environment irrespective of where they are located. By enhancing the interaction of the user with these new technologies, we will provide a better UX that would create an efficient system which reduces the overall costs of managing the plant and concretely realize the aspirations of Industry 4.0.",

      "Abstract": " Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.The excitation of the wind turbine by the wind represents one of the main sources of excitation for the components of the wind turbine. The resulting structural loads can be measured relatively easily. The measurement of wind excitation, however, is much more complex. Even with the latest measuring equipment, such as LiDAR, the spatially and temporally high-resolution wind measurement required for the validation of the load measurement in the time domain can only be realized with a disproportionately high financial outlay and is thus unsuitable for large-scale application in the field. The method presented here shall be able to generate a realistic spatial wind excitation by means of the measured wind information present at each wind turbine, thus enabling model and load validation in the time domain. Furthermore, the method is fast enough to calculate the wind excitation in real time, allowing for application in Hardware-in-Loop or as part of a digital twin of the wind turbine.",

      "Abstract": " 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.This work analyses methods of digital model development and uses electronics production as an example. It focuses on the analysis of the visual tools of a digital manufacturing system design. The digital model development process is divided into a sequence of tasks, to solve which a number of models, methods and tools is proposed. These procedures can be used to perform simulation modelling, performance prediction, promising option selection, parameters optimisation of both the device itself and its manufacturing mechanisms along with other lifecycle components, without the expensive sample tests, field tests or introduction of any changes to the already established manufacturing, selling, service and other infrastructures. Digitalisation aspects are covered by creating interrelated digital models of the device and the digital manufacturing process model that take all the technical and economic aspects into account. This approach, called Digital Twin (of the actual production), underlies the modern Industry 4.0 concept that suggests the introduction of different cyber-physical systems in the manufacturing systems. The proposed method of the visual system design uses a complex of software tools to produce digital system models of an electronics manufacturing system. The resulting digital twin of the actual manufacturing is representative of both the produced device and its manufacturing process design features. And it can be used for preparation, analysis and manufacturing improvement purposes.",

They aim to solve insufficient guidance methods in the existing enterprise service remote assistance guidance system. In this paper, a digital twin-driven enterprise service remote assistance guidance system is proposed. The digital twin system is designed to carry out different all-around analyses of the remote internal system. The digital and physical spaces of the enterprise service system are reset according to the data query results. The proposed model achieves the internal data mapping effect of the enterprise service and analyzes the internal data of the system. Based on the realization of real-time mapping and a large amount of twin data generated by virtual and real interaction, the data are visualized and stored in a database for the upper layers. The proposed model has been simulated, and the test results show its potential benefits for enterprise control, optimization, and forecasting and can provide essential support for realizing the twin's optimized control of entities.",

      "Abstract": " 2020 by the authors.In the literature, many applications of Digital Twin methodologies in the manufacturing, construction and oil and gas sectors have been proposed, but there is still no reference model specifically developed for risk control and prevention. In this context, this work develops a Digital Twin reference model in order to define conceptual guidelines to support the implementation of Digital Twin for risk prediction and prevention. The reference model proposed in this paper is made up of four main layers (Process industry physical space, Communication system, Digital Twin and User space), while the implementation steps of the reference model have been divided into five phases (Development of the risk assessment plan, Development of the communication and control system, Development of Digital Twin tools, Tools integration in a Digital Twin perspective and models and Platform validation). During the design and implementation phases of a Digital Twin, different criticalities must be taken into consideration concerning the need for deterministic transactions, a large number of pervasive devices, and standardization issues. Practical implications of the proposed reference model regard the possibility to detect, identify and develop corrective actions that can affect the safety of operators, the reduction of maintenance and operating costs, and more general improvements of the company business by intervening both in strictly technological and organizational terms.",

We conducted a controlled experimental study to compare a HoloBoard class with a normal class through measuring students' learning outcomes and three dimensions of engagement (i.e., behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement). We used pre-/post- knowledge tests and multimodal learning analytics to measure students' learning outcomes and learning experiences. Results indicated that the lecture-based class utilizing HoloBoard lead to slightly better learning outcomes and a significantly higher level of student engagement.

Multiple stakeholders, including designers, building facility managers, and policy makers, are making decisions to reduce SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission and make our environment safer; however, systems to effectively and interactively evaluate virus transmission in physical spaces are lacking. To help fill this gap, we propose OccSim, a system that automatically generates occupancy behaviours in a 3D model of a building and helps users analyze the potential effect of virus transmission from a large-scale and longitudinal perspective. Our participatory evaluation with four groups of stakeholders revealed that OccSim could enhance their decision making processes by identifying specific risks of virus transmission in advance, and illuminating how each risk relates to complex human-building interactions. We reflect on our design and discuss OccSim's potential implications in the domains of gdesign evaluation,' ggenerative design,' and gdigital twins.'",

Physical, behavioural, rule and geometric models are constructed from the four perspectives of the effect of each element in the scene on the train, the dynamic characteristics of the train, the correlation between the elements and the scene, and the visualization of the scene. Based on digital twin, the paper designs the framework of simulation platform to support ATO performance optimization and other work.

They progress through lifecycle phases of creation, production, operations, and disposal. The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to \u201cnormal accidents.\u201d We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running.

      "Abstract": " 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.In this paper, the development of a Digital Twin of a beverages pasteurization system for temperature monitoring, using NI Lab-VIEW control system toolkit, is described. A cyber-physical production system, composed of a real-time simulation tool and a controller, has been set up and tested on a pilot plant set up in a university laboratory. The paper shows how the software platform, together with the hardware, has been implemented in a traditional system, not (yet) ready for Industry 4.0 technologies, and therefore underlines the main issues occurred during its development. The Digital Twin includes a CompactRIO controller and a set of probes, connected with the controller. The aim of the Digital Twin is to monitor the machine status, with a particular attention to the temperature reached by the service water and the required steam flow. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this system, a set of experimental tests has also been carried out.",

      "Abstract": " The digital twin paradigm aims to fuse information obtained from sensor data, physics models, and operational data for a mechanical component in use to make well-informed decisions regarding health management and operations of the component. In this work, we discuss a methodology for digital-twin-based operation planning in mechanical systems to enable: a) cost-effective maintenance scheduling, and b) resilient operations of the system. As properties of mechanical systems, as well as their operational parameters, loads and environment are stochastic in nature, our methodology includes probabilistic damage diagnosis, probabilistic damage prognosis, and system optimization under uncertainty. As an illustrative example, we consider the problem of fatigue crack growth in a metal component. We discuss a probabilistic, ultrasonic-guided-wave-based crack diagnosis framework that can handle both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties in the diagnosis process. We build a high-fidelity, finite element model to simulate the piezoelectric effect and ultrasonic guided wave propagation. We use test data obtained by conducting diagnostic experiments on the physical twin to calibrate the error in the diagnosis model. We perform Bayesian diagnosis of crack growth using the corrected diagnosis model, considering data corrupted by measurement noise, and fuse the information from multiple sensors. We build a finite-element-based high-fidelity model for crack growth under uniaxial cyclic loading, and calibrate a phenomenological (low-fidelity) fatigue crack growth model using the high-fidelity model output as well as data from fatigue loading experiments performed on the physical twin. We use the resulting multi-fidelity model in a probabilistic crack growth prognosis framework; thus achieving both accuracy and computational efficiency. Lastly, we utilize the damage diagnosis framework along with the damage prognosis model to optimize system operations under diagnostic and prognostic uncertainty. We perform simulation experiments that show how the digital twin of the component of interest can be used for intelligent health management and operation planning for mechanical systems.",

A shift towards higher degree of automation within existing infrastructure is often challenged by high cost and complex processes, thus a return-on-investment is hardly achievable within decent time. The experience has shown that it is hard to assess all restrictions and interactions between new and old components before any new equipment or infrastructure is implemented and put into operation. This paper presents and discusses if the usage of digital twins representing and simulating a physical part can support the related assessing and decision-making processes.

This concept allows implementing an accurate digital model of an electrical network with bidirectional automatic data exchange, used for modeling, optimization, and control. The core of such a model is an agent (potential digital twin). The agent, while constantly interacting with a physical object (electrical grid), searches for an optimal strategy for active network management, which involves short-term strategies capable of controlling the power supplied by generators and/or consumed by the load to avoid overload or voltage problems. Such an agent can verify its training with the initial default policy, which can be considered as a teacher's advice. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on a test 77-node scheme and a real 17-node network diagram of the Akademgorodok microdistrict (Irkutsk) according to the data from smart electricity meters.",

The efficiency of smart cities, smart manufacturing, smart transport, etc. can be provided only if the measurement information coming from sensors is trustworthy. In each facility, the number of sensors can vary from thousands to tens of thousands. The avalanche-like growth in the number of measuring instruments should be accompanied by quite frequent check of their metrological serviceability. In this case, a significant reduction in maintenance labour costs can be achieved by increasing calibration or verification intervals by many times. The development in this direction is challenging because of the growing demand for the increase in the number of complex properties that should be quantitatively estimated. The fundamentals of metrological check and features of applying object digital twins for debugging multichannel measuring systems have been given. The need for international standards in this field has been emphasised.",

      "Abstract": " 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.When architecting Software-intensive Systems-of-Systems (SoS) on the Internet-of-Things (IoT), architects face two sorts of uncertainties. First, they have only limited knowledge about the operational environment where the SoS will actually be deployed. Second, the constituent systems which will compose the SoS might not be known a priori (at design-time) or their availability (at run-time) is affected by dynamic factors, due to the openness of the IoT. The consequent research question is thereby how to deal with uncertainty in the design of an SoS architecture on the IoT. To tackle this challenging issue, this paper addresses the notion of uncertainty due to partial information in SoS and proposes an enhanced SoS Architecture Description language (SosADL) for expressing SoS architectures on the IoT under uncertainty. The core SosADL is extended with concurrent constraints and the concept of digital twins coupling the physical and virtual worlds. This novel approach is supported by an integrated toolset, the SosADL Studio. Validation results demonstrate its effectiveness in an SoS architecture for platooning of self-driving vehicles.",

This is more notorious in a virtual ambient where the data is generated in a manner that is faster and easier to analyze than in the real world. This is very evident in the retail field, where virtual stores have easy access to all the advertisement a user visited and simple to obtain user profile, on the other hand physical stores are limited to basically create a register in a database when there is a purchase. In an attempt to improve the retailers experience from physical stores to manage their business this document has the objective to develop a computational tool that will analyze the people flux going in the establishment, trying to inform the retailer the amount of people and their gender to help the sales process in physical stores. To this end, computational vision methods and algorithms were raised, which after selection, theoretical conception and tool\u2019s implementation it was tested with benchmarks to operate locally and in real time by accessing the cameras installed strategically in a real scenario. Two scenarios were tested: static ambient light and dynamic light. Two tests were conducted: YOLOv2 against background subtraction-based counter; gender classification using full body features. Even though the results were not as positive as needed for commercial use, the tool demonstrated potential and space for improvements.",

      "Abstract": " 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.Digital twins are essential for Industry 4.0 and the digitalization of research, development and manufacturing. By now, the models contain more and more information and are already often highly complex systems. However, an important step is to keep the model as simple as possible in order to reduce computing resources and the associated simulation time. The Indoor Environment Simulation Suite (IESS) is a tool to generate a zonal model from a CAD geometry. It is designed to simulate the transient indoor climate in a short time, while still considering all important physical processes (heat conduction, radiation, convection). After the zonal model has been generated, the user can parameterize it specifically to the application and couple it with other models when needed. Here, a new approach is to integrate a thermo-physiological model of the human body in order to make statements about the human perception of thermal comfort. This is of particular interest in early development phases in order to assess air conditioning strategies as well as structural or technical adaptions due to thermal bridges or other influences on the cabin climate. In this paper a concept will be presented where the zonal model is coupled with the thermo-physiological model to investigate selected case studies on how thermal comfort in a regional aircraft can be assessed and considered in early design phases. The cabin model is based on a new type of regional aircraft for which a mock-up is currently being built in order to perform subject test at the Fraunhofer Institute in Holzkirchen. The thermal model can thus make statements in advance about how test scenarios should be carried out in order to gain the greatest possible benefit from the subject study tests, where the number of different tests is limited.",

      "Abstract": " 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.During the last years, several research activities and studies have presented the possibility to perform manufacturing control using distributed approaches. Although these new approaches aim to deliver more flexibility and adaptability to the shop floor, they are not being readily adopted and utilised by the manufacturers. One of the main challenges is the unpredictability of the proposed solutions and the uncertainty associated with these approaches. Hence, the proposed research aims to explore the utilisation of Digital Twins (DTs) to predict and understand the execution of these systems in runtime. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is leading to the emergence of new concepts amongst which DT stand out. Given their early stage, however, the already existing implementations are far from standardised, meaning that each practical case has to be analysed on its own and solutions are often created from scratch. Taking the aforementioned into account, the authors suggest an architecture that enables the integration between a previously designed and developed agent-based distributed control system and its DT, whose implementation is also provided in detail. Furthermore, the digital model\u2019s calibration is described jointly with the careful validation process carried out. Thanks to the latter, several conclusions and guidelines for future implementations were possible to derive as well.",

      "Abstract": " 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Surrogate Modeling (SM) is often used to reduce the computational burden of time-consuming system simulations. However, continuous advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the spread of embedded sensors have led to the creation of Digital Twins (DT), Design Mining (DM), and Soft Sensors (SS). These methodologies represent a new challenge for the generation of surrogate models since they require the implementation of elaborated artificial intelligence algorithms and minimize the number of physical experiments measured. To reduce the assessment of a physical system, several existing adaptive sequential sampling methodologies have been developed; however, they are limited in most part to the Kriging models and Kriging-model-based Monte Carlo Simulation. In this paper, we integrate a distinct adaptive sampling methodology to an automated machine learning methodology (AutoML) to help in the process of model selection while minimizing the system evaluation and maximizing the system performance for surrogate models based on artificial intelligence algorithms. In each iteration, this framework uses a grid search algorithm to determine the best candidate models and perform a leave-one-out cross-validation to calculate the performance of each sampled point. A Voronoi diagram is applied to partition the sampling region into some local cells, and the Voronoi vertexes are considered as new candidate points. The performance of the sample points is used to estimate the accuracy of the model for a set of candidate points to select those that will improve more the model\u2019s accuracy. Then, the number of candidate models is reduced. Finally, the performance of the framework is tested using two examples to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method.",

However, enterprises seeking to adopt PLE at all levels of their organization, including areas such as product marketing, portfolio planning, manufacturing, supply chain, product sales, product service and maintenance, Internet-of-Things, resource planning, and much more are finding that thousands of nonengineering users need different views and interaction scenarios with a feature diversity representation. This paper describes a feature ontology (a specification of the meaning of terms in the feature modeling realm) that is suitable for managing the feature-based product line engineering and operations in the largest and most complex product line organizations. This ontology is based on layers of abstraction that each incrementally constrain the complexity and combinatorics and targets specific roles in the organization for greater degrees of efficiency, precision, and automation across an entire business enterprise.",

Publication rights licensed to ACM.Recent advances in the large-scale adoption of information and communication technologies in manufacturing processes, known as Industry 4.0 or Smart Manufacturing, provide us a window into how the manufacturing sector will evolve in the coming decades. As a result of these initiatives, manufacturing firms have started to integrate a series of emerging technologies into their processes that will change the way products are designed, manufactured, and consumed. This article provides a comprehensive review of how service-oriented computing is being employed to develop the required software infrastructure for Industry 4.0 and identifies the major challenges and research opportunities that ensue. Particular attention is paid to the microservices architecture, which is increasingly recognized as offering a promising approach for developing innovative industrial applications. This literature review is based on the current state of the art on service computing for Industry 4.0 as described in a large corpus of recently published research papers, which helped us to identify and explore a series of challenges and opportunities for the development of this emerging technology frontier, with the goal of facilitating its widespread adoption.",

      "Abstract": " 2021 Owner/Author.Driver assistance systems are currently evaluated using standardized test procedures as defined, for example, by Euro NCAP, but which only represent a narrow, idealized spectrum of real-life situations. Test conditions hardly take into account the variability that occur in everyday traffic - adverse weather conditions such as fog, rain, snow or darkness are typically not considered, nor are the resulting changes in, e.g., the behavior of pedestrians. In an emergency braking situation, the behavior of the VRU can also be directly affected by the interaction with the vehicle. For example, a pedestrian might be alarmed by an approaching car. This could elicit a very different response in the human that cannot be simulated in the dummy motion as defined in the standard test procedure. In order to create a more versatile and interactive simulation and test environment, we have developed the Mixed Reality Test Environment MiRE. The goal of Mixed Reality Test Environment MiRE is to enable testing of a broader range of scenarios, including interaction between VRUs and vehicles. During the demo, we will demonstrate MiRE live to interested visitors and show its full potential for future driving safety tests.",

These methods apply artificial targets to trigger the safety critical functions under specific predefined scenarios, as the NCAP or IIHS test catalogues. Despite having a good reproducibility, these approaches hardly permit the evaluation of new interaction concepts like external Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs), since the interaction between real users and the vehicle cannot be realistic reproduced without risks to the participants. The novel Mixed Reality Test Environment (MiRE) overcomes this limitation by the integration of Virtual Reality (VR) technologies, Dynamic Vehicle-in-the-Loop (DynViL) and the Virtual Environment. In MiRE the movement and positioning of the vehicles and the VRUs are tracked in real time and reproduced in the virtual environment. Synthetic data from the virtual environment is generated to stimulate the vehicle and the human participant, enabling a safe interaction between both entities.",

      "Title": "Fused Twins: A Cognitive Approach to Augmented Reality Media Architecture",
      "Abstract": " 2021 Owner/Author.Recent advances in Augmented Reality (AR), the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and Digital Twins transform the types, rates, and volume of information generated in buildings as well as the mediums through which they can be perceived by users. These advances push the standard approach of media architecture to embed screens in the built environment to its limits because screens lack the immersive capacity that newer media afford. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel AR approach to media architecture that uses a Digital Twin as a platform for structuring and accessing data from various sources, including IoT and simulations. Our technical contribution to media architecture is threefold. First, we extend the possibilities of media architecture beyond embedded screens to three dimensions by presenting a Digital Twin using AR with a head-mounted display. This approach results in a shared and consistent augmented experience across large architectural spaces. Second, we use the Digital Twin to integrate and visualize real physical sensor information. Third, we make artificial occupancy simulations accessible to everyday users by presenting them within their natural context in the Digital Twin. Observing the Digital Twin in situ of the Physical Twin also has applications beyond media architecture. Fusing the two twins using AR can reduce the cognitive load of users from consuming big and complex information sources and enhance their experience. We present two use cases of the proposed Fused Twins in a university building at ETH Z\u00fcrich. In the first use case, we visualize a dense indoor sensor network (DISN) with 390 IoT sensors that collected data from March 2020 to May 2021. In the second use case, we immerse visitors in agent-based simulations to enable insights into the real and projected uses of space. This work brings forward an ambitious vision for media architecture beyond traditional flat screens, and showcases its potential through fusing state of the art simulations, sensor data integration and augmented reality, finally making the jump from fiction to reality.",

      "Abstract": " 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).With the advent of digitalization in industrial settings, referred to as Industry 4.0, more and more machine data is being collected and analyzed during a machine's life cycle. The availability to leverage machine data allows the concept of the Digital Twin. The more data that is collected the more statistically relevant and reliable the digital representation. This data within the Digital Twin is usually hard to access and to consume by humans. Typically, there is just a web-based user interface or basic queries available to mine the data. Therefore, we propose the concept of a Virtual Twin, which is an interactive virtual representation (virtual 3D model) of a physical object. The benefit of a Virtual Twin is that machines and equipment are arranged in the same way and at the same position in relation to each other as their real-world counterparts. The virtual 3D representation functions as an intuitive gateway to the corresponding Digital Twin. In this paper, we present the concept and implementation of the Virtual Twin and discuss potential use cases as well as areas of application.",

      "Abstract": " 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).Industrial products tend to be customized by third-parties for different use cases. This is currently supported by adding external Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) to installations. As IoT software ecosystems become wide-spread, the need for such hardware will decrease. However, removing the controllers opens the challenge of configuring distributed industrial installations. This paper argues for modeling application requirements on industrial installations so that they can be evaluated automatically based on information about targeted installations. GIMLE, a visual language for modeling application requirements using expressive domain knowledge, is proposed. GIMLE enables modeling requirements on physical features of installations, which hasn't received significant attention in the related work. A study with domain experts is used to reflect on the proposed process. The scalability of the visual language is evaluated using a model for a real-world application. The support for reuse of requirements enabled us to build models that can add support for new installations without significant changes and with a slower increase in size the more components can be reused.",

      "Abstract": " 2021 Owner/Author.Cholesteric Spherical Reflectors (CSRs) are made of droplets of cholesteric liquid crystals (the same material under the screen of our mobile phones) but molded in a spherical shape and hardened into a solid. CSRs have a peculiar behavior when illuminated: they reflect light and produce unique optical patterns whose full display is hardly predictable. They have been argued to behave like an optical Physical Unclonable Function (PUF), therefore finding application in anti-counterfeiting, in particular for object authentication. However, a fundamental challenge remains open: to understand what makes each optical response unique and how to extract this identifying information reliably and repeatedly. We study the problem, and we design and discuss two pivotal procedures to build authentication protocols for objects coated with CSRs. We test the quality of our procedures against large data sets of pattern images: images from CSRs are used to calculate inter- and intra-distance; simulated patterns created artificially are used to measure security in terms of false positive ratio. Our procedures successfully cluster images coming from the same CSR, distinguishing them from images of different CSRs and decoys. Our work is one of the few that has studied procedures of information extraction for materials derived from CSRs. It advances the state of the art in this area, closing the gap between the research on optical PUFs and practical applications.",

      "Abstract": " 2019 IEEE.Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) represent systems which integrate physical units and processes with computational entities over Internet and allow ubiquitous access of information and services. Although the application of CPSs promise to positively transform many application fields, there are still many open questions and challenges on how to design and realize a CPS. As indicated in the third level of the 5-level CPS architecture, the so-called cyber level, one of the challenges addresses the need for digital twins as high-fidelity mirroring images of CPSs entities. This is a prerequisite to realize the upper levels of the 5-level CPS architecture-the cognition and configuration level. In the scientific literature, the concept of a Digital Twin is introduced as a concrete realization for mirroring physical entities in the virtual world. However, a reference framework for the main building blocks of a Digital Twin framework is missing. This hinders a reuse of best practices and proven solutions for concrete realizations of a Digital Twin. In order to tackle this problem, we have established a reference framework for Digital Twins within a CPS. Our framework specifies the main building blocks of a Digital Twin in terms of structure and interrelations. To achieve this goal, we performed a systematic literature review, where we evaluated existing Digital Twin realizations used in different application domains of CPSs and we applied Grounded Theory and Framework Analysis as underlying methodologies. This reference framework serves a blueprint for developing Digital Twins of physical entities which are part of a CPS.",

      "Abstract": " 2019 IEEE.Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) aims to provide a systems engineering methodology that leverages modeling methods to support design, analysis, verification, and validation of systems. As such, methodologies for MBSE have to be able to integrate heterogeneous engineering models from a variety of domains, including mechanical engineering, product design, legislation, and many more. Most research in this area usually only focuses on general system descriptions of a step in the system development process, without providing any interdisciplinary or interprocess connections. Thus, the models created by the domain experts are often unconnected and not suited for automated model transformations. We present a method to integrate abstract system descriptions in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models, which are not only the primary model for geometrical hardware descriptions but also the starting point of most process chains in the context of virtual product development. The transformations of our method are realized in a plug-in for the MagicDraw modeling environment and support to generate parameters of a parameter and constraint CAD modeling approach from a SysML model. This automates the integration of abstract system descriptions with design models to foster a coherent virtual product development.",

      "Abstract": "\u00c2 2021 ACM.Ubiquitous mobile computing have enabled ride-hailing services to collect vast amounts of behavioral data of riders and drivers and optimize supply and demand matching in real time. While these mobility service providers have some degree of control over the market by assigning vehicles to requests, they need to deal with the uncertainty arising from self-interested driver behavior since workers are usually free to drive when they are not assigned tasks. If a driver's behavior can be accurately replicated on the digital twin, more detailed and realistic counterfactual simulations will enable decision making to improve mobility services as well as to validate urban planning. In this work, we formulate the problem of passenger-vehicle matching in a sparsely connected graph and proposed an algorithm to derive an equilibrium policy in a multi-agent environment. Our framework combines value iteration methods to estimate the optimal policy given expected state visitation and policy propagation to compute multi-agent state visitation frequencies. Furthermore, we developed a method to learn the driver's reward function transferable to an environment with significantly different dynamics from training data. We evaluated the robustness to changes in spatio-temporal supply-demand distributions and deterioration in data quality using a real-world taxi trajectory dataset; our approach significantly outperforms several baselines in terms of imitation accuracy. The computational time required to obtain an equilibrium policy shared by all vehicles does not depend on the number of agents, and even on the scale of real-world services, it takes only a few seconds on a single CPU.",

Of course, human hands are much more sophisticated, able to form rich 3D poses capable of far more complex interactions than poking at a screen. In this paper, we describe how conventional capacitive touchscreens can be used to estimate 3D hand pose, enabling richer interaction opportunities. Importantly, our software-only approach requires no special or new sensors, either internal or external. As a proof of concept, we use an off-the-shelf Samsung Tablet flashed with a custom kernel. After describing our software pipeline, we report findings from our user study, we conclude with several example applications we built to illustrate the potential of our approach.",

Subsystem models are created by various engineering design tools. During the design process there exists an extraordinary amount of generated data resulting from created models, simulation, and engine field tests. This data can be leveraged by artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning to help accelerate the exploration of the large design spaces existing in the complex system of a gas engine. This paper presents a vision and road map of integrating such AIs and preliminary ideas on relevant AI models for such use cases. We explore increasing the realistic nature of existing simulations, approximating simulations to avoid excess computation, and cumulative effect modeling.",

      "Abstract": " 2019 IEEE.In the context of Smart Ecosystems, systems engage in dynamic cooperation with other systems to achieve their goals. Expedient operation is only possible when all systems cooperate as expected. This requires a level of trust between the components of the ecosystem. New systems that join the ecosystem therefore first need to build up a level of trust. Humans derive trust from behavioral reputation in key situations. In Smart Ecosystems (SES), the reputation of a system or system component can also be based on observation of its behavior. In this paper, we introduce a method and a test platform that support virtual evaluation of decisions at runtime, thereby supporting trust building within SES. The key idea behind the platform is that it employs and evaluates Digital Twins, which are executable models of system components, to learn about component behavior in observed situations. The trust in the Digital Twin then builds up over time based on the behavioral compliance of the real system component with its Digital Twin. In this paper, we use the context of automotive ecosystems and examine the concepts for building up reputation on control algorithms of smart agents dynamically downloaded at runtime to individual autonomous vehicles within the ecosystem.",

By intertwining non-physical and physical processes they seamlessly integrate interdependent computational and physical components. In this contribution we take a closer look on structural constellations of CPS and their components that refer to autonomy. We also take into account development aspects and demonstrate encoding autonomy aspects into a behavior-centered representation scheme for digital twins. It features encapsulation on various layers of abstraction in the course of design and choreography for self-contained while networked operation of CPS as System-of-Systems. As digital twin models created in the course of CPS design activities can be executed automatically, the implementation and adaptation of CPS (components) is intertwined with design activities. Consequently, users can act as designers and experience CPS behavior through digital twin execution interactively. Critical elements, such as managing private data in healthcare, can be monitored and adapted to individual needs.",

However, current methods are largely restricted to single buildings; these methods require energy and occupancy monitoring sensor deployments, which can be expensive and difficult to deploy at scale. Further, current methods for estimating energy consumption and population at scale cannot provide fine enough temporal or spatial granularity for a reasonable personal energy footprint estimate. In this work, we present a data-driven system for city-wide estimation of personal energy footprints. This system takes advantage of existing sensing infrastructure and data sources in urban cities to provide energy and population estimates at the building level, even in built environments that do not have existing or accessible energy or population data.",

Smart manufacturing promises to improve these aspects. One key approach that is being pursued in this context is the creation of centralized software-defined control (SDC) architectures and strategies that use diverse sensors and data sources to make manufacturing more adaptive, resilient, and programmable. In this paper, we present SDCWorks- A modeling and simulation framework for SDC. It consists of the semantic structures for creating models, a baseline controller, and an open source implementation of a discrete event simulator for SDCWorks models. We provide the semantics of such a manufacturing system in terms of a discrete transition system which sets up the platform for future research in a new class of problems in formal verification, synthesis, and monitoring. We illustrate the expressive power of SDCWorks by modeling the realistic SMART manufacturing testbed of University of Michigan. We show how our open source SDCWorks simulator can be used to evaluate relevant metrics (throughput, latency, and load) for example manufacturing systems.",

Digital Twins take on a unique role here. However, the question of what a Digital Twin is and what differentiates it from a regular model is still open. We present an experimental setup for integrating an existing simulation model of Hamburg's traffic system with the city's real-time sensor network. The Digital Twin is implemented using the large-scale multi-agent framework MARS. The entire process from the model description to retrieving real-time data from the IoT sensors and incorporating it in the simulation is presented. As a first prototypical example, a multi-modal mobility model was connected to real-world bike-sharing locations in Hamburg. We find that the combination of multi-agent systems and IoT sensors as a Digital Twin shows enormous potential for city planners, policy stakeholders, and other decision-makers. By correcting the course of a simulation via real-time data, the corridor-of-uncertainty that is intrinsic to some simulation models' use can be reduced significantly. Furthermore, any divergence of simulated and sampled data can lead to a deeper understanding of complex adaptive systems like big cities.",

      "Abstract": " 2018 IEEE.The efficacy of drug treatments depends on how tightly small molecules bind to their target proteins. Quantifying the strength of these interactions (the so called 'binding affinity') is a grand challenge of computational chemistry, surmounting which could revolutionize drug design and provide the platform for patient specific medicine. Recently, evidence from blind challenge predictions and retrospective validation studies has suggested that molecular dynamics (MD) can now achieve useful predictive accuracy (1 kcal/mol) This accuracy is sufficient to greatly accelerate hit to lead and lead optimization. To translate these advances in predictive accuracy so as to impact clinical and/or industrial decision making requires that binding free energy results must be turned around on reduced timescales without loss of accuracy. This demands advances in algorithms, scalable software systems, and intelligent and efficient utilization of supercomputing resources. This work is motivated by the real world problem of providing insight from drug candidate data on a time scale that is as short as possible. Specifically, we reproduce results from a collaborative project between UCL and GlaxoSmithKline to study a congeneric series of drug candidates binding to the BRD4 protein-inhibitors of which have shown promising preclinical efficacy in pathologies ranging from cancer to inflammation. We demonstrate the use of a framework called HTBAC, designed to support the aforementioned requirements of accurate and rapid drug binding affinity calculations. HTBAC facilitates the execution of the numbers of simulations while supporting the adaptive execution of algorithms. Furthermore, HTBAC enables the selection of simulation parameters during runtime which can, in principle, optimize the use of computational resources whilst producing results within a target uncertainty.",

      "Abstract": " 2021 ACM.Whether testing intrusion detection systems, conducting training exercises, or creating data sets to be used by the broader cybersecurity community, realistic user behavior is a critical component of a cyber range. Existing methods either rely on network level data or replay recorded user actions to approximate real users in a network. Our work produces generative models trained on actual user data (sequences of application usage) collected from endpoints. Once trained to the user's behavioral data, these models can generate novel sequences of actions from the same distribution as the training data. These sequences of actions are then fed to our custom software via configuration files, which replicate those behaviors on end devices. Notably, our models are platform agnostic and could generate behavior data for any emulation software package. In this paper we present our model generation process, software architecture, and an investigation of the fidelity of our models. Specifically, we consider two different representations of the behavioral sequences, on which three standard generative models for sequential data-Markov Chain, Hidden Markov Model, and Random Surfer-are employed. Additionally, we examine adding a latent variable to faithfully capture time-of-day trends. Best results are observed when sampling a unique next behavior (regardless of the specific sequential model used) and the duration to take the behavior, paired with the temporal latent variable. Our software is currently deployed in a cyber range to help evaluate the efficacy of defensive cyber technologies, and we suggest additional ways that the cyber community as a whole can benefit from more realistic user behavior emulation.",

This automation enables numerous useful real-life use-cases, such as smart transport, smart living, smart cities, and so on. However, recent industry surveys reflect that data-related challenges are responsible for slower growth of IoT in recent years. For this reason, this article presents a systematic and comprehensive survey on IoT Big Data (IoTBD) with the aim to identify the uncharted challenges for IoTBD.

      "Abstract": " 2020 ACM.In this study, we develop a platform that can display approximately 20 types of data via a web browser to realize a digital twin of a wider area, including a detailed reading display of block units and individual three-dimensional point cloud data (point cloud) of a city. Using actual data, we examine if the data model and visualization design correspond with the zoom level. Owing to the comparative examination of the wide-area display performance and the map representation design in a JavaScript-based open-source library, we were able to develop a platform with light architecture and an easily customizable display. Furthermore, prototyping, based on Mapbox GL JS and Deck.GL, and the display of spatiotemporal flow layers, such as background maps, point cloud data in many places, dozens of layer display types, and the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) allowed for the seamless transition from the local government to the wide-area display in the prefecture unit in approximately 10-20 s. It is recommended that this digital smart city platform should be standardized by other local governments, especially in areas where higher-order data visualization is yet to advance. To display this digital city in a lightweight environment, we consider the digital data situation of local governments in Japan. It is necessary to define the visualized design for each zoom level according to the characteristics of the data. We then arranged the display model of each zoom level for 20 types of urban infrastructure data related to the digital smart city by referring to the style schema of the tile form. Through these tasks, we organized the commonality and optimization of data models and formats.",

      "Title": "Ensuring a Robust Multimodal Conversational User Interface during Maintenance Work",
      "Abstract": " 2021 ACM.It has been shown that the provision of a conversational user interface proves beneficial in many domains. But, there are still many challenges when applied in production areas, e.g. as part of a virtual assistant to support workers in knowledge-intensive maintenance work. Regarding input modalities, touchscreens are failure-prone in wet environments and the quality of voice recognition is negatively affected by ambient noise. Augmenting a symmetric text- and voice-based user interface with gestural input poses a good solution to provide both efficiency and a robust communication. This paper contributes to this research area by providing results on the application of appropriate head and one-hand gestures during maintenance work. We conducted an elicitation study with 20 participants and present a gesture set as its outcome. To facilitate the gesture development and integration for application designers, a classification model for head gestures and one for one-hand gestures were developed. Additionally, a proof-of-concept for operators' acceptance regarding a multimodal conversational user interface with support of gestural input during maintenance work was demonstrated. It encompasses two usability testings with 18 participants in different realistic, but controlled settings: notebook repair (SUS: 82.1) and cutter head maintenance (SUS: 82.7).",

Complementing professional observers - the current best practice - automated pedagogical professional development systems can attend every class and capture fne-grained details of all occupants. One particularly valuable facet to capture is class gaze behavior. For students, certain gaze patterns have been shown to correlate with interest in the material, while for instructors, student-centered gaze patterns have been shown to increase approachability and immediacy. Unfortunately, prior classroom gaze-sensing systems have limited accuracy and often require specialized external or worn sensors. In this work, we developed a new computer-vision-driven system that powers a 3D digital twin of the classroom and enables whole-class, 6DOF head gaze vector estimation without instrumenting any of the occupants. We describe our open source implementation, and results from both controlled studies and real-world classroom deployments.",

      "Abstract": " 2020 ACM.Remote Health Monitoring (RHM) has the potential to increase operational safety in extreme environments. Negative stress exposure influences mission success or the short- and long-term health conditions of deployed personnel. To quantify negative stress, we introduce a washable smart textile with integrated sensors. Analyzing the transmitted sensor values, medical advisors monitor up to 72 sensor values in parallel in case of an average group size of eight people. In order to aggregate the amount of data, we propose a stress level scale that includes stress trends. To predict individual stress levels based on sensor data, environmental quantities and the individual physiological fingerprint, we train different machine learning models. To evaluate such models, we implement a data acquisition environment to label data snapshots. Therefore, we do not need to collect in-field data and expose humans to negative stress. Moreover, we can mock sensor failures and rare, but relevant, sensor value combinations that are difficult to acquire in real-world scenarios. Our evaluation environment identifies Random Forest Regressor from a set of 25 models to perform best to predict individual stress levels. This model performs 23.19 times better than a zero rule classifier to distinguish among nine stress levels for mission goal health condition and 10.50 times better for mission goal mission success. Finally, we present our current RHM user interface design. It addresses issues such as information overload, avatar sympathy and unnecessary navigation paths.",

      "Title": "Kalibre: Knowledge-based Neural Surrogate Model Calibration for Data Center Digital Twins",
      "Abstract": " 2020 ACM.Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model has been widely used for prototyping data centers. Evolving it to high-fidelity digital twin is desirable for the management and operations of large-scale data centers. Manually calibrating CFD model parameters to achieve twin-class fidelity by specially trained domain expert is tedious and labor-intensive. To reduce manual efforts, existing automatic calibration approaches developed for various computational models apply heuristics to search model configurations within an empirically defined parameter bound. However, in the context of CFD, each search step requires long-lasting CFD model's iterated solving, rendering these approaches impractical with increased model complexity. This paper presents Kalibre, a knowledge-based neural surrogate approach that performs CFD model calibration by iterating four key steps of i) training a neural surrogate model based on CFD-generated data, ii) finding the optimal parameters at the moment through neural surrogate retraining based on sensor-measured data, iii) configuring the found parameters back to the CFD model, and iv) validating the CFD model using sensor-measured data as the ground truth. Thus, the parameter search is offloaded to the neural surrogate which is ultra-faster than CFD model's iterated solving. To speed up the convergence of Kalibre, we integrate prior knowledge of the twinned data center's thermophysics into the neural surrogate design to improve its learning efficiency. With about five hours computation on a 32-core processor, Kalibre achieves mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 0.81\u00b0C and 0.75\u00b0C in calibrating two CFD models for two production data halls hosting thousands of servers each while requires fewer CFD solving processes than existing baseline approaches.",

      "Abstract": " 2021 ACM.Demands for agents that replicate the characteristics of specific individuals are increasing. Although ways to implement personality traits into the virtual agents' movement have been widely researched, ways to create aspects of individuality that can be identified as belonging to specific individuals have not. To clarify how well humans can identify individuals from short movements and what elements of movement contribute to the perception of individuality, we examined the relationship between the degree of confidence in personal identification and statics of gesture movement. In the experiment, participants were asked to compare pairs of short presentation animations and give their degree of confidence that the two animations were of the same person. The animations were created with motion data from performers and with 3D-CG characters to reduce the differences in appearances and shot angles. We calculated five expressivity parameters from the wrist movement for each gesture and compared the answers from the participants. The results showed that the participants were able to distinguish individuals doing the same action and recognize the individuals by the spatial and temporal extents of their movement, which were represented by how much space they use and how fast they moved their wrists. This study clarifies the cognitive aspects of what elements need to be reproduced to develop agents with individuality.",

The novel contribution of this work is to determine the cardiac compliances from the morphology of the single-lead ECG signal and Systemic resistance estimation from the information of the exercise level for a specific subject performing physical activities. Simulation results are produced employing an open-source database (Troika), and it shows medically accepted trends in all the derived cardiac variables.

      "Abstract": " 2021 ACM.The field of Supply Chain Management (SCM) is experiencing rapid strides in the use of Industry 4.0 technologies and the conceptualization of new supply chain configurations for online retail, sustainable and green supply chains, and the Circular Economy. Thus, there is an increasing impetus to use simulation techniques such as discrete-event simulation, agent-based simulation, and hybrid simulation in the context of SCM. In conventional supply chain simulation, the underlying constituents of the system like manufacturing, distribution, retail, and logistics processes are often modelled and executed as a single model. Unlike this conventional approach, a distributed supply chain simulation (DSCS) enables the coordinated execution of simulation models using specialist software. To understand the current state-of-the-art of DSCS, this paper presents a methodological review and categorization of literature in DSCS using a framework-based approach. Through a study of over 130 articles, we report on the motivation for using DSCS, the modelling techniques, the underlying distributed computing technologies and middleware, its advantages and a future agenda, and also limitations and trade-offs that may be associated with this approach. The increasing adoption of technologies like Internet-of-Things and Cloud Computing will ensure the availability of both data and models for distributed decision-making, which is likely to enable data-driven DSCS of the future. This review aims to inform organizational stakeholders, simulation researchers and practitioners, distributed systems developers and software vendors, as to the current state-of-the art of DSCS, and which will inform the development of future DSCS using new applied computing approaches.",

Although cyber-physical digital twins have received a lot of recent attention, their cyber-cyber counterparts have been comparatively overlooked. In this paper we show how the unique properties of cyber-cyber digital twins open up exciting opportunities for research and development. Like all digital twins, the cyber-cyber digital twin is both informed by and informs the behaviour of the twin it simulates. It is therefore a software system that simulates another software system, making it conceptually truly a twin, blurring the distinction between the simulated and the simulator. Cyber-cyber digital twins can be twins of other cyber-cyber digital twins, leading to a hierarchy of twins. As we shall see, these apparently philosophical observations have practical ramifications for the design, implementation and deployment of digital twins at Facebook.",

      "Title": "SMARTLAGOON: Innovative modelling approaches for predicting socio-environmental evolution in highly anthropized coastal lagoons",
      "Abstract": " 2021 ACM.Coastal lagoons are ecosystems with significant environmental and socio-economic value. However, these natural systems are especially vulnerable to climatic and anthropogenic pressures, such as intensive agriculture and extensive urbanization as a consequence of the tourist development. Despite the vulnerability and complexity of these ecosystems, there has been limited development of novel techniques which can provide real-time monitoring, analysis and management of these critical resources. Beyond being useful for policy-making procedures at multiple levels of granularity, such tools can increase local and citizen awareness of environmental impacts. This paper introduces the key concept behind the SMARTLAGOON project, which intends to develop a digital twin to build a systemic understanding of the socio-environmental inter-relationships affecting coastal lagoons and their ecosystem. Particularly, we focus on the main research activities carried out since the beginning of the project (January 1st, 2021), which are mainly based on initial mapping and reporting of the main stakeholders' needs and wishes in relation to the technological products to be developed in SMARTLAGOON. This will onset the initial development pathway, while additional stakeholder inputs during the project lifetime will help to further explore and prioritize the key developments, thus maximizing the relevance and impact of the Mar Menor's digital twin.",

      "Abstract": " 2021 ACM.With the increasing proportion of wind power technology in China's energy structure, the fault diagnosis technology of generators, which is the key equipment of wind power generation, is becoming increasingly important. At present, the methods of the fault diagnosis of wind turbines are mostly based on traditional SCADA systems and big data analysis technology. The fault diagnosis process is complicated. Based on the current mature Internet technology, this paper introduces the concept of the Industrial Internet information model into the fault diagnosis of wind turbines and realizes the intelligentization of fault diagnosis of wind turbines. At the same time, the feasibility analysis of this scheme was carried out by studying the existing related cases. The results show that the information model has a stronger application prospect in the fault diagnosis of wind turbines. Compared with traditional methods, the new solution proposed in this paper makes the operation and maintenance and diagnosis of wind turbines more ideal.",

      "Abstract": " 2021 ACM.This paper presents the first entirely open-source and cross-platform software called Open3DGen for reconstructing photorealistic textured 3D models from RGB-D images. The proposed software pipeline consists of nine main stages: 1) RGB-D acquisition; 2) 2D feature extraction; 3) camera pose estimation; 4) point cloud generation; 5) coarse mesh reconstruction; 6) optional loop closure; 7) fine mesh reconstruction; 8) UV unwrapping; and 9) texture projection. This end-To-end scheme combines multiple state-of-The-Art techniques and provides an easy-To-use software package for real-Time 3D model reconstruction and offline texture mapping. The main innovation lies in various Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques that are used with additional depth data to yield high-quality 3D models in real-Time and at low cost. The functionality of Open3DGen has been validated on AMD Ryzen 3900X CPU and Nvidia GTX1080 GPU. This proof-of-concept setup attains an average processing speed of 15 fps for 720p (1280x720) RGBD input without the offline backend. Our solution is shown to provide competitive 3D mesh quality and execution performance with the state-of-The-Art commercial and academic solutions.",

The academic research efforts on AI have followed a trend of development of complex and resource-intensive algorithms that require cloud-centric architectures while the industrial architectures for data acquisition are in most cases distributed, fragmented and resource-constrained. Recent researches have demonstrated the need of moving toward a decentralized use of AI where data analysis algorithms are executed directly on the machine side (\"on the edge\"). As this is the future, it becomes evident that a new generation of AI and ML experts, able to adapt these technologies to the industrial needs and to foster their role as the key players of the 4th industrial revolution, is needed.

The triggers stimulated by end-users interest have introduced the first generation of mass-consumer wearables in just the past decade. Evidently, the trailblazing ones were not designed with strict energy-consumption restrictions in mind. Thus, wearable-computing-related research remained fragmented. Advanced and sophisticated batteries and communication technologies could be already procurable on devices. Additional solutions for efficient utilization of processing power are still a white spot on the wearable technology roadmap.

      "Title": "Event Prediction in the Big Data Era: A Systematic Survey",
      "Abstract": " 2021 ACM.Events are occurrences in specific locations, time, and semantics that nontrivially impact either our society or the nature, such as earthquakes, civil unrest, system failures, pandemics, and crimes. It is highly desirable to be able to anticipate the occurrence of such events in advance to reduce the potential social upheaval and damage caused. Event prediction, which has traditionally been prohibitively challenging, is now becoming a viable option in the big data era and is thus experiencing rapid growth, also thanks to advances in high performance computers and new Artificial Intelligence techniques. There is a large amount of existing work that focuses on addressing the challenges involved, including heterogeneous multi-faceted outputs, complex (e.g., spatial, temporal, and semantic) dependencies, and streaming data feeds. Due to the strong interdisciplinary nature of event prediction problems, most existing event prediction methods were initially designed to deal with specific application domains, though the techniques and evaluation procedures utilized are usually generalizable across different domains. However, it is imperative yet difficult to cross-reference the techniques across different domains, given the absence of a comprehensive literature survey for event prediction. This article aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive survey of the technologies, applications, and evaluations of event prediction in the big data era. First, systematic categorization and summary of existing techniques are presented, which facilitate domain experts' searches for suitable techniques and help model developers consolidate their research at the frontiers. Then, comprehensive categorization and summary of major application domains are provided to introduce wider applications to model developers to help them expand the impacts of their research. Evaluation metrics and procedures are summarized and standardized to unify the understanding of model performance among stakeholders, model developers, and domain experts in various application domains. Finally, open problems and future directions are discussed.",

      "Title": "Model-based clinical assist system for cardiac ablation",
      "Abstract": " 2021 ACM.Cardiac Ablation is an effective treatment of arrhythmia in which physicians terminate fast heart rate by transecting abnormal electrical conduction pathways in the heart with RF energy. During the procedure, physicians diagnose the condition of the heart and locate ablation sites by analyzing electrical signals sensed by catheters inserted into the heart. Due to the limited observation of the patient's heart, there may exist multiple heart conditions that can explain historical observations, causing ambiguities in the patient's heart condition. During the procedure, physicians have to visualize and continuously update these suspected heart conditions in their mind, causing heavy mental burden on the physicians. In this paper, cardiac electrophysiology is formalized using a physiological model of the heart, such that the diagnosis problem during cardiac ablation can be formalized as parameter identification and state estimation problems with the heart model. We then propose a model-based clinical assist system which partially solves the diagnosis problem during cardiac ablation. The system enumerates suspected heart conditions by creating \"digital twins\"of the patient's heart with heart models. The heart models are used to represent and visualize suspected heart conditions, and are systematically updated and removed with new information during the ablation procedure. The system provides more rigorous and intuitive interpretation of current understanding of the patient's heart, and improves the accuracy and efficiency of cardiac ablation procedures by relieving the physicians from demanding low-level reasoning.",

Achieving this for new buildings is feasible, but it may be difficult to transform existing buildings to ZEBs. Digital twins provide a promising approach to monitor existing buildings and further increase their energy efficiency. A digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a physical entity. It has several applications in product design, product cycle, and fault detection. This paper presents a hybrid approach that combines physics-based and machine learning methods to create a DT for the built environment. A case study for a digital twin of a single room is also discussed. The initial comparison of cooling energy between the physical testbed and the DT model shows promising results for future development. The limitations, challenges, and future development of the approach are also addressed in the paper.",

      "Abstract": " 2021 Owner/Author.In recent years, the digital twin has been one of the active research areas in modern Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Both the digital twin and its physical counterpart, called a plant, are highly intertwined such that they continuously exchange data to reveal useful information about the overall system. Such class of CPSs need to be robust to various types of disturbances, such as faulty sensors and model discrepancies, since the interplay between the physical plant's operation and digital twin's simulation may lead to undesirable or even destructive effect. To address this problem, this paper introduces a flexible anomaly detection framework for monitoring anomalous behaviours in digital twin based CPSs. In particular, our approach integrates both the digital twin and data-driven techniques that detect and classify anomalous behaviours due to modelling errors (e.g. incomplete models) and sensor and physical system's faults. The framework can be deployed to any general CPSs without the full knowledge of the digital twin's internal model. Therefore, our method is amenable to various types of digital twin implementations that enhance the traditional data-driven anomaly detection mechanism. We demonstrate the performance of our approach using the Tennessee Eastman Process model. The experimental result shows our approach is able to effectively detect and classify anomaly sources from the physical plant, sensor and digital twin, even in the situation when a certain combination of multiple anomalies occur simultaneously.",

Therefore, fishery farmers have started adopting smart fisheries technologies to better manage their fish farms. Despite their technological advancements smart fisheries are exposed and vulnerable to cyber-attacks that would cause a negative impact on the ecosystem both physically and economically. Therefore in this paper, we present a smart fisheries ecosystem where the architecture describes various interactions that happen between internet connected devices. We develop a smart fisheries ontology based on the architecture and implement Attribute Based Access Control System (ABAC) where access to resources of smart fisheries is granted by evaluating the requests. We also discuss how access control decisions are made in multiple use case scenarios of a smart fisheries ecosystem. Furthermore, we elaborate on some AI applications that would enhance the smart fisheries ecosystem.",

Due to their high digitization and controllable energy systems, the DCs can act as flexible assets, being able to dynamically adapt their energy profiles and valuable energy services. We present a flexibility management solution that is using a Digital Twin model of DC systems to determine action plans for shifting energy load. DC monitored data is acquired by integration with existing DC infrastructure management (DCIM) while energy predictions are computed for DC energy demand, energy flexibility, and heat generation. The flexibility optimization plans for DC operation are determined and enforced after DC manager validation via DCIM integration. Five energy services are identified as suitable to be provided by the DC with the help of described flexibility management solution: energy trading for increasing profit, grid congestion management by decreasing DC energy demand, scheduling by increasing DC energy demand to consume as much as possible the renewable available in the local grid, power factor compensation and sell heat on demand.",

      "Abstract": " 2021 ACM.Fast localization of earth faults in medium voltage grids is required in order to avoid subsequent faults and to quickly restore the normal grid operation. We propose a localization approach utilizing a signature database with high-resolution transient voltages. The database is created based on a digital twin of a live medium-voltage grid for which measurements of voltages during actual earth faults of known location are available. The robustness and accuracy of two different realizations of the signature based fault localization are investigated: (1) a comparison approach using a correlation metric; (2) a neural network that has been trained by the signatures provided by the digital twin. The performance of our approach is assessed based on artificially generated earth fault events as well as real field measurements from the electrical grid.",

      "Title": "Neural network modeling as a method for creating digital twins: From Industry 4.0 to Industry 4.1",
      "Abstract": " 2020 ACM.Digital twins are one of the key technologies behind the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In the coming years they will be introduced on a large scale in the industry and in other spheres. A wide range of digital twins will be in demand: from separate components to complex technical facilities, such as automobiles, airplanes, manufacturing lines, factories, corporations, etc. To provide their successful interaction, it is important to create digital twins on the uniform principles. Currently, creating a digital twin is a complex scientific issue. It presents difficulties because it is necessary not only to describe physical (or chemical, biological, etc.) processes going on in the object, but also to envisage significant changes of its properties in the course of its operation. In this case the digital twin is supposed to adapt to the changes in the original object in accordance with the data received from the sensors. The aim of the research was to define the strategies of solving the current problems in such areas as digital twins, the internet of things and cyberphysical systems. In order to achieve this aim, the following problems were supposed to be solved: - Consider the definitions of the digital twin suggested in the world scientific literature - Find a unified data-driven real-time approach to creating digital twins - Suggest using the neural network approach in creating digital twins. During the use of the modelled object, specifics of the physical processes going on in it and object properties can change. The model is supposed to adapt in accordance with these changes, which is rather difficult if a model is generated by applying computer-aided engineering software packages (CAE) based on classical numerical methods. We consider the multistage technique as more promising. It involves building an adaptive model at the second stage. Such a model can be specified and redesigned based on real-time data. Since neural networks have proved to be efficient in solving complicated problems related to data processing, we recommend using them as the basic class of mathematical models for creating digital twins.",

The starting point for the investigation was the observation that physiotherapists are bricoleurs-that is, practitioners who are skillful in creatively using the available materials in their environment. We conducted co-design workshops with physiotherapists that informed the development of a prototype toolkit, the ExerTiles, comprising a set of interactive tiles with control components. The toolkit was assessed by seven physiotherapists who created balance training exercises for two older adults each. Post-test interviews revealed that all the physiotherapists were highly positive toward using the ExerTiles as part of their professional work. The following five factors contributed toward the acceptance of ExerTiles by the physiotherapists: tailorability, versatile training, creativity, fun, and portability. Our research indicates that tangible interactive technology has a strong potential to integrate with and add value to physiotherapy practice.",

      "Abstract": " 2020 ACM.Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease characterized by numerous, hard to predict periods of relapse and remission. \"Digital twin\"approaches, leveraging personalized predictive models, would significantly enhance therapeutic decision-making and cost-effectiveness. However, the associated computational and statistical methods require high quality data from a large population of patients. Such a comprehensive repository is very challenging to build, though, and none is available for IBD. To overcome this, a promising approach is to employ a knowledge graph, which is built from the available data and would help predicting IBD episodes and delivering more relevant personalized therapy at the lowest cost. In this research, we present a knowledge graph developed on the basis of patient records which are collected from one of the largest German gastroentologic outpatient clinic. First, we designed IBD ontology that encompasses the vocabulary, specifications and characteristics associated by physicians with IBD patients, such as disease classification schemas (e.g., Montreal Classification of IBD), status of the disease activity, and medications. Next, we defined the mappings between ontology entities and database variables. Physicians and project members participating in the Fraunhofer MED2ICIN project, validated the ontology and the knowledge graph. Furthermore, the knowledge graph has been validated against the competency questions compiled by physicians.",

Existing industry 4.0 application development approaches are centered on commercial IoT platforms that provide siloed development and runtime environments (leading to vendor lockdown) and only support individual sensors and actuators instead of entire machines. Therefore, Industry 4.0 applications need to construct representations of complex machines from such basic elements, which is a costly, error-prone, inefficient hindering portability across machines and plants. This paper proposes Cyber Twins, a comprehensive solution for efficient Industry 4.0 application development, testing, and portability.

Co-simulation plays a key role in this by allowing the system as a whole to be simulated by composing simulations of its parts. The ability to do this coupling relies on the models adhering to a well-defined interface. The Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) defines this interface and the models that implemented it are called Functional Mockup Units (FMUs). While a wealth of specialized simulation tools can generate FMUs, they are often commercial and do not support of complex software prototypes. Rather than implement these as FMUs from scratch (FMI requires expertise in C), losing valuable time, the contribution presented in this paper is a tool that allows FMUs to be implemented rapidly in Python. The advantages of this are demonstrated in an industrial use case, where a tracking simulator is implemented as an FMU.",

To support personalization of high quality products, companies try to establish Information Technology (IT) systems. Typical IT systems are Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) used in the design department and Manufacturing Execution System (MES) used in the production department. Problems arise during the production of such highly personalized products using only information from 2D drawings. It is also inefficient that information about malfunctions and defects during production is sent back to the design department through manual operations. To resolve these problems, a method of exchanging the 3D shape with malfunction and defect information between PLM and MES is proposed. 3D shapes have been exchanged using open source and web-based PLM, MES, and CAD systems. The result shows that interoperability between PLM and MES is possible with visualization support.",

Firstly, the machine tool digital twin (MTDT) is introduced to provide real-time device data for evaluating machine tools. Based on MTDT, a real-time multi-agent-based mechanism (RTMAM) is designed for solving DMTS. Then based on exponential scale, the Analytic Hierarchy Process is modified for calculating the weight of evaluation index.

Model-based Engineering and DevOps aim to efficiently deliver software with increased quality. Model-based Engineering relies on models as first-class artifacts to analyze, simulate, and ultimately generate parts of a system. DevOps focuses on software engineering activities, from early development to integration, and then improvement through the monitoring of the system at run-time. We claim these can be efficiently combined to improve the engineering process of CPS. In this paper, we present TwinOps, a process that unifies Model-based Engineering, Digital Twins, and DevOps practice in a uniform workflow. TwinOps illustrates how to leverage several best practices in MBE and DevOps for the engineering Cyber-Physical systems. We illustrate our contribution using a Digital Twins case study to illustrate TwinOps benefits, combining AADL and Modelica models, and an IoT platform.",

      "Title": "Towards a digital twin for cyber-physical production systems: A multi-paradigm modeling approach in the postal industry",
      "Abstract": " 2020 ACM.This paper presents our early-stage research on a Multi-Paradigm Modeling (MPM) approach as an initial step towards the definition of a Digital Twin (DT) for Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). This work takes place in the context of the digitalization of the mail sorting process at La Poste, the French national postal service company. Indeed, La Poste is currently investing on robotics modules for automatically loading mail containers. The main objective is to reduce the painful work for human operators while optimizing the robots usage. We already worked on targeting such a balance in a past effort that resulted in the production of different kinds of models of the La Poste CPPS. However, these models were defined separately and are not directly related to the underlying business process in particular. Thus, we propose an MPM approach starting from this business process as now modeled explicitly in a BPMN model. Then, we refine the high-level business activities into finer-grained activities represented in a UML Activity model. From these latest, we derive the specification of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) developed with the JADE framework and emulating the behavior of the La Poste CPPS. Our longer term objective is to pave the way for supporting the definition of a DT for this CPPS, and potentially for other CPPSs in different contexts in the future.",

      "Title": "Towards employing ABM and MAS integrated with MBSE for the lifecycle of sCPSoS",
      "Abstract": " 2020 ACM.Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are natural evolutions of embedded systems consisting of embedded computing devices and networks interacting with physical processes and possibly with a human. By introduction of Internet of Things (IoT), and Industry 4.0, CPSs are used in an interconnected way each of which may belong to a different stakeholder, building a complex System of Systems (SoS) called CPSoS. These systems need to employ some techniques to transform the collected data to knowledge with which the system can make better decisions. These capabilities can create smart CPSoS or sCPSoS. However, these systems are highly complex from both structural and behavioural point of views. Naturally, there is a need for multiple abstraction levels using different paradigms to model these system, called Multi-Paradigm modeling (MPM). In this paper, the challenges and opportunities of using agent technologies, including intelligent agents, Agent-based modeling and Simulation (ABM), and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) (or Agent-oriented Software Engineering (AOSE)) in an integrated way with Model-based System Engineering (MBSE) techniques are discussed to cover the whole lifecycle of sCPSoS, from simulation and analysis, to development, operation and monitoring.",

      "Title": "Integrating digital twin security simulations in the security operations center",
      "Abstract": " 2020 ACM.While industrial environments are increasingly equipped with sensors and integrated to enterprise networks, current security strategies are generally not prepared for the growing attack surface that resides from the convergence of their IT infrastructure with the industrial systems. As a result, the organizations responsible for corporate security, the Security Operations Center (SOC), are overwhelmed with the integration of the industrial systems. To facilitate monitoring the industrial assets, digital twins represent a helpful novel concept. They are the virtual counterparts of such assets and provide valuable insights through collecting asset-centric data, analytic capabilities and simulations. Moreover, digital twins can assist enterprise security by simulating attacks and analyzing the effect on the virtual counterpart. However, the integration of digital twin security simulations into enterprise security strategies, that are mainly controlled by the SOC, is currently neglected. To close this research gap, this work develops a process-based security framework to incorporate digital twin security simulations in the SOC. In the course of this work, a use case along with a digital twin-based security simulation provides proof of concept. It is demonstrated how a man-in-the-middle attack can be performed in a simulated industry setting and how it affects the systems. Moreover, we show how the resulting system logs can support the SOC by building technical rules to implement in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.",

Big Data technologies play a significant role within IoT processes, as visual analytics tools, generating valuable knowledge in real-time in order to support critical decision making. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of visualization methods, tools, and techniques for the IoT. We position data visualization inside the visual analytics process by reviewing the visual analytics pipeline. We provide a study of various chart types available for data visualization and analyze rules for employing each one of them, taking into account the special conditions of the particular use case. We further examine some of the most promising visualization tools. Since each IoT domain is isolated in terms of Big Data approaches, we investigate visualization issues in each domain. Additionally, we review visualization methods oriented to anomaly detection. Finally, we provide an overview of the major challenges in IoT visualizations.",

The focus is on the security impacts to the DevSecOps culture, process, and pipeline. These impacts stem from faulty implementations of requirements in order to achieve a full DevSecOps environment. The faulty implementations resulted in a lax security posture facilitating potential compromise in many areas of the software development environment. We discuss each of the faulty implementations in detail and provide recommendations to avoid in future engagements. The main lesson learned was the organization's inability to strictly adhere to DevSecOps principles resulted in a dysfunctional software development environment and a reduced security posture.",

      "Abstract": " 2020 ACM.Lean manufacturing has been the primary approach for creating highly efficient manufacturing processes since the early 1990s. It may be very successful due to its effectiveness in reducing complexity and heading off unnecessary works or waste. At present, the term Industry 4.0 depicts a vision of the future manufacturing system. Previous researches indicate the possibility to integrate and combine the lean approach and industry 4.0 system. Previous researches suggest that there are positive relationships between the two concepts. Besides, they conclude that integrating the lean approach and industry 4.0 leads to a greater cost reduction than implementing only one of them. The current paper summarizes and proposes a conceptual framework that can guide the implementation of the integration of lean manufacturing and industry 4.0.",

      "Abstract": " 2020 ACM.A design-centric modeling approach was proposed to model the behaviour of the physical processes controlled by Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and study the cascading impact of data-oriented attacks. A threat model was used as input to guide the construction of the CPS model where control components which are within the adversary's intent and capabilities are extracted. The relevant control components are subsequently modeled together with their control dependencies and operational design specifications. The approach was demonstrated and validated on a water treatment testbed. Attacks were simulated on the testbed model where its resilience to attacks was evaluated using proposed metrics such as Impact Ratio and Time-to-Critical-State. From the analysis of the attacks, design strengths and weaknesses were identified and design improvements were recommended to increase the testbed's resilience to attacks.",

However, current methods are largely restricted to single buildings; these methods require energy and occupancy monitoring sensor deployments, which can be expensive and difficult to deploy at scale. Further, current methods for estimating energy consumption and population cannot provide fine enough temporal or spatial granularity for a reasonable personal energy footprint estimate. In this work, we present CityEnergy, a data-driven system for city-wide estimation of personal energy footprints.

      "Abstract": " 2020 ACM.Cyber-physical systems that implement self-adaptive behavior, such as autonomous robots, need to ensure that requirements remain satisfied across run-time adaptations. The Robot Operating System (ROS), a middleware infrastructure for robotic systems, is widely used in both research and industrial applications. However, ROS itself does not assure self-adaptive behavior. This paper introduces AC-ROS, which fills this gap by using assurance case models at run time to manage the self-adaptive operation of ROS-based systems. Assurance cases provide structured arguments that a system satisfies requirements and can be specified graphically with Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) models. AC-ROS uses GSN models to instantiate a ROS-based MAPE-K framework, which in turn uses these models at run time to assure system behavior adheres to requirements across adaptations. For this study, AC-ROS is implemented and tested on EvoRally, a 1:5-scale autonomous vehicle.",

      "Abstract": " 2019 ACM.With progressing digitalization and the trend towards autonomous computing, systems tend to form digital ecosystems, where each autonomous system aims at achieving its own goals. Within a highway ecosystem, for example, autonomous vehicles could deploy smart agents in the form of software applications. This would enable cooperative driving and ultimately formation of vehicle platoons that reduce air friction and fuel consumption. In the smart grid domain, software-defined virtual power plants could be established to enable remote and autonomous collaboration of various units, such as smart meters, data concentrators, and distributed energy resources, in order to optimize power generation, demand-side energy and power storage. Effective collaboration within these emerging digital ecosystems strongly relies on the assumption that all components of the ecosystem operate as expected, and a level of trust among them is established based on that. In this paper, we present the idea of trust-based digital ecosystems, built upon the concept of a digital twin of this ecosystem, as a machine readable representation of the system and a representation of goals and trust at runtime. This creates demand for introducing a reference architecture for trust-based digital ecosystems that would capture their main concepts and relationships. By modeling the goals of the actors and systems, a reference architecture can provide a basis for analyzing competitive forces that influence the health of an ecosystem.",

      "Abstract": " 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.Machines that are used in industry often require dedicated technicians to fix them in case of defects. This involves travel expenses and certain amount of time, both of which may be significantly reduced by installing small extensions on a machine as we describe in this paper. The goal is that an authorized local worker, guided by a remote expert, can fix the problem on the real machine himself. Our approach is to equip a machine with multiple inexpensive LEDs (light-emitting diodes) and a simple micro controller, which is connected to the internet, to remotely light up certain LEDs, that are close to machine parts of interest. The blinking of an LED can be induced on a virtual 3D model (digital twin) of the machine by a remote expert using a virtual reality application to draw the local worker\u2019s attention to certain areas. We conducted an initial user study on this concept with 36 participants and found significantly shorter completion times and less errors for our approach compared to only voice guidance with no visual LED feedback.",

We outline how we used design methodology to organise an interdisciplinary workshop with a diverse group of students - a workbook sprint with 45 participants from four different programs and 13 countries - to develop speculative design futures in five focus areas. We then provide insights into our findings and share our lessons learned regarding our workshop topic - AI and Space - our process, and our research. We learned that involving non-experts in complex technical discourses - such as AI - through the structural rigour of design methodology is a viable approach.

Prior to classification, the 3D point clouds are clustered using either Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) or k-means algorithms. We then use randomly sampled 3D point normal vectors as an entropy descriptor to calculate the direction and position of the virtual camera, which is placed around these clusters. It synthesizes 2D images of a given cluster from multiple views with positions and directions that have highest visual entropy. We then proceed to classify the images using a retrained CNN. We test our approach for classifying common office furniture items using both synthetic and actual 3D point clouds of typical indoor office spaces. The empirical results demonstrate that our approach is suited towards classifying specific indoor furniture objects.We also describe how our approach can be implemented as a lightweight component within a service-oriented system that is used for visualization and classification of 3D point clouds using a given Web3D tool. The resulting semantically-enriched 3D point clouds can further be used for digital indoor environment representations, with further use as base data for Building Information Modeling (BIM), Facility Management (FM), and Digital Twin (DT) applications.",

All Rights Reserved.When wearing a head-mounted display (HMD) in everyday environments, interactions with real world bystanders often fail due to the visual barrier. As a result, the HMD user takes off the headset, which ends the virtual reality (VR) experience. We address this problem by providing a shared surface with the same content for both users, which is located at the same physical position in the real and the virtual world. In a between-subject user study (N = 40), we investigate the effects of a shared surface for short-term collaboration in co-located mixed-presence scenarios. We compare (a) real-world collaboration, (b) having a shared surface only and (c) combining the shared surface with an avatar representation of the real world user in VR. We could show that shared surfaces are helpful for mixed-presence collaboration. Adding an avatar in VR improves performance measures such as task-completion time, error rate and number of clarifying questions.

Publication rights licensed to ACM.Autopilot systems are typically composed of an \u201cinner loop\u201d providing stability and control, whereas an \u201couter loop\u201d is responsible for mission-level objectives, such as way-point navigation. Autopilot systems for unmanned aerial vehicles are predominately implemented using Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control systems, which have demonstrated exceptional performance in stable environments. However, more sophisticated control is required to operate in unpredictable and harsh environments. Intelligent flight control systems is an active area of research addressing limitations of PID control most recently through the use of reinforcement learning (RL), which has had success in other applications, such as robotics. Yet previous work has focused primarily on using RL at the mission-level controller. In this work, we investigate the performance and accuracy of the inner control loop providing attitude control when using intelligent flight control systems trained with state-of-the-art RL algorithms-Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, Trust Region Policy Optimization, and Proximal Policy Optimization. To investigate these unknowns, we first developed an open source high-fidelity simulation environment to train a flight controller attitude control of a quadrotor through RL. We then used our environment to compare their performance to that of a PID controller to identify if using RL is appropriate in high-precision, time-critical flight control.",

      "Abstract": " 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.The rapid digitalization of the Facility Management (FM) sector has increased the demand for mobile, interactive analytics approaches concerning the operational state of a building. These approaches provide the key to increasing stakeholder engagement associated with Operation and Maintenance (O&M) procedures of living and working areas, buildings, and other built environment spaces. We present a generic and fast approach to process and analyze given 3D point clouds of typical indoor office spaces to create corresponding up-to-date approximations of classified segments and object-based 3D models that can be used to analyze, record and highlight changes of spatial configurations. The approach is based on machine-learning methods used to classify the scanned 3D point cloud data using 2D images. This approach can be used to primarily track changes of objects over time for comparison, allowing for routine classification, and presentation of results used for decision making. We specifically focus on classification, segmentation, and reconstruction of multiple different object types in a 3D point-cloud scene. We present our current research and describe the implementation of these technologies as a web-based application using a services-oriented methodology.",

      "Title": "Optimizing carbon tax for decentralized electricity markets using an agent-based model",
      "Abstract": " 2020 ACM.Averting the effects of anthropogenic climate change requires a transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon technology. A way to achieve this is to decarbonize the electricity grid. However, further efforts must be made in other fields such as transport and heating for full decarbonization. This would reduce carbon emissions due to electricity generation, and also help to decarbonize other sources such as automotive and heating by enabling a low-carbon alternative. Carbon taxes have been shown to be an efficient way to aid in this transition. In this paper, we demonstrate how to to find optimal carbon tax policies through a genetic algorithm approach, using the electricity market agent-based model ElecSim. To achieve this, we use the NSGA-II genetic algorithm to minimize average electricity price and relative carbon intensity of the electricity mix. We demonstrate that it is possible to find a range of carbon taxes to suit differing objectives. Our results show that we are able to minimize electricity cost to below \u00a310/MWh as well as carbon intensity to zero in every case. In terms of the optimal carbon tax strategy, we found that an increasing strategy between 2020 and 2035 was preferable. Each of the Pareto-front optimal tax strategies are at least above \u00a381/tCO2 for every year. The mean carbon tax strategy was \u00a3240/tCO2.",

      "Abstract": " 2020 ACM.As Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as the next logical stage of the Internet, it has become imperative to understand the vulnerabilities of the IoT systems when supporting diverse applications. Because machine learning has been applied in many IoT systems, the security implications of machine learning need to be studied following an adversarial machine learning approach. In this paper, we propose an adversarial machine learning based partial-model attack in the data fusion/aggregation process of IoT by only controlling a small part of the sensing devices. Our numerical results demonstrate the feasibility of this attack to disrupt the decision making in data fusion with limited control of IoT devices, e.g., the attack success rate reaches 83% when the adversary tampers with only 8 out of 20 IoT devices. These results show that the machine learning engine of IoT system is highly vulnerable to attacks even when the adversary manipulates a small portion of IoT devices, and the outcome of these attacks severely disrupts IoT system operations.",

      "Title": "Systematization of Digital Twins: Ontology and Conceptual Framework",
      "Abstract": " 2020 ACM.The development and progress in information and communication technologies will transform traditional products into smart products and allow to offer novel smart services [1]. Herein, the digital twin (DT) concept is regarded as a key technology to create value with smart services [2]. Although the research and applications of DTs emerge continuously many concerns are to be scrutinized [3]. The lack of a shared conceptual framework for DTs with an unambiguous terminology [4] complicates cross-functional discussions. Therefore, a systematization of the main dimensions of DTs is proposed in the form of an ontology and a conceptual framework thereof derived. The research questions addressed in this paper are a) \u00abWhich dimensions are used to classify and structure DTs in academic literature?\u00bb, b) \u00abWhat are the fundamental differences or specifications within these dimensions?\u00bb and c) \u00abHow do these different specifications relate to each other?\u00bb The focus of the research is on the objective to find classification systematics that are a) representing the entire spectrum of DTs, b) universally valid in all DT related domains and c) applicable in research and practice. A systematic literature review on the relevant aspects of DTs was conducted and the findings iteratively advanced within workshop sessions with academic experts. DTs are considered as integrators of physical and digital worlds as well as internal and external value creation. Further, the creation of DTs requires per definition the use of digital data. Hence, the proposed ontology and conceptual framework for DTs include the following main dimensions to consider for every DT: Data resources, external value creation and internal value creation. The main subdimensions of the data resources are the data sources to obtain the data, the data categories and the data formats. The main subdimension of the external value creation are the attributes of the services as the basis of the value propositions, the level of smartness of the connected products and the actors on the different levels of the ecosystem. The main subdimensions of the internal value creation are the lifecycle phases of products, the product management levels and the different generations of both. The proposed ontology and conceptual framework support researchers and practitioners in positioning and structuring their intended DT activities and communicating them to internal and external stakeholders. The holistic view on the data resource dimension further allows to easily deduct the needed data for certain applications or deduct possible applications from already available data.",

      "Title": "On the Engineering of IoT-Intensive Digital Twin Software Systems",
      "Abstract": " 2020 ACM.Digital Twins (DT) are software systems representing different aspects of a physical or conceptual counterpart - -the real twin, which is instrumented with several sensors or computing devices that generate, consume and transfer data to its DT with different purposes. In other words, DT systems are, to a large extent, IoT-intensive systems. Indeed, by exploiting and managing IoT data, artificial intelligence, and big data and simulation capabilities, DTs have emerged as a promising approach to manage the virtual manifestation of real-world entities throughout their entire lifecycle. Their proliferation will contribute to realizing the long-craved convergence of virtual and physical spaces to augment things and human capabilities. In this context, despite the proposal of noteworthy contributions, we argue that DTs have not been sufficiently investigated from a software engineering perspective. To address this, in this paper we propose GEMINIS, an architectural reference model that adopts self-adaptation, control, and model-driven engineering techniques to specify the structural and behavioural aspects of DTs and enable the evolution of their internal models. Moreover, we introduce an approach for engineering IoT-intensive Digital Twin Software Systems (DTSS) using GEMINIS' capabilities to deal with uncertain conditions that are inherent to the nature of mirrored physical environments and that might compromise the fidelity of a DT. With GEMINIS and the proposed approach, we aim to advance the engineering of DTSS as well as IoT and cyber-physical systems by providing practitioners with guidelines to model and specify inherent structural and behavioural characteristics of DTs, addressing common design concerns.",

      "Abstract": " 2020 ACM.When developing autonomous systems, engineers and other stakeholders make great efforts to prepare the system for all foreseeable circumstances. However, such systems are still bound to encounter situations that were not considered at design time. For reasons like safety, cost, or ethics it is often highly desired that these new cases be handled correctly upon first encounter. In this paper, we first justify our position that there will always exist unpredicted events and conditions, driven by, e.g., new inventions in the real world, the diversity of world-wide system deployments and uses, and the possibility that multiple events that were unforeseen at design time (or overlooked, or knowingly abandoned following cost-benefit-risk calculations) will not only occur, but will occur together. We then argue that despite the unpredictability, handling such situations is indeed possible. Hence, we offer and exemplify design principles, which, when applied in advance, can improve the system's ability to deal with unpredicted situations. We conclude with a discussion of how this work and a much-needed thorough study of the unexpected can contribute toward a foundation of engineering principles for developing trustworthy next-generation autonomous systems.",

Since lithium-ion batteries are perishable goods and underlie e. g. aging effects, environmental and operating conditions during manufacturing and car usage need close supervision. With regard to the paradigm of digital twins, data from various life cycle phases needs to be collected and processed to improve the general quality of the system. To achieve this complex task, a suitable framework is needed in order to operate the fleet of digital twins during manufacturing processes, the automotive usage and a potential second life. Based on a literature review, we formulate requirements for a digital twin framework in the field of battery systems. We propose a framework to develop and operate a fleet of digital twins during all life cycle phases. Results feature a case study in which we implement the stated framework in a cloud-computing environment using early stages of battery system production as test a bed. With the help of a self-discharge model of li-ion cells, the system can estimate the SOC of battery modules and provide this information to the arrival testing procedures.",

      "Abstract": " 2019 Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS).Forests have crucial importance for the sustainability of Earth and humanity and one of the biggest threats to the existence of forests are the fires. This paper proposes a conceptual model for mitigating forest fire risk by use of self-adaptive and autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Memoryless property of exponential distribution is also reflected and considered in the calculations of forest fire probabilities. Stochastic and dynamic properties of the situation and the mathematical complexity of the routing problem entailed and justified a simulation study. The effectiveness of the proposed dispatching approach for routing UAVs and the validity of the proposed model are tested on a small sized realistic scenario. Experimental results encourage the development of complex models. Integrating the proposed model with advanced information technologies may lead to the development of a digital twin system.",

      "Abstract": " 2020 ACM.Product design based on mechanical performance requirements and with given boundary conditions is a frequent and demanding engineering problem. In most cases, effectiveness of the design is limited to expertise of the respective designer, which also results in inefficient and incomplete exploration of the product's design space. With a large amount of data available and recent advancements in hardware technology, data-driven methods have become an increasingly common strategy for problems that are difficult to formulate or expensive to solve by creating a physical model, but such methods often lack the application perspective; they are not yet widely applied especially in engineering product development. Generative design (here, more precisely generative engineering) is one such technique which has recently gained importance. Although many preliminary studies demonstrate plausible results from data-driven generative design approaches, a closeloop-3D-generative-design-pipeline that achieves full automation and optimization of the design with respect to the product's functional requirements is still in its nascent stage. This paper proposes a generalized hybrid framework comprised of both data-based and physics-based methods to achieve this objective, as represented by the teaser figure 1. An overview of various possibilities for individual modules of the framework is also discussed.",

      "Abstract": " 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).Autonomous driving is expected to provide a range of far-reaching economic, environmental and safety benefits. I n t h is s t udy, we propose a fog computing based framework to assist autonomous driving. Our framework relies on overhead views from cameras and data streams from vehicle sensors to create a network of distributed digital twins, called an edge twin, on fog machines. The edge twin will be continuously updated with the locations of both autonomous and human-piloted vehicles on the road segments. The vehicle locations will be harvested from overhead cameras as well as location feeds from the vehicles themselves. Although the edge twin can make fair road space allocations from a global viewpoint, there is a communication cost (delay) in reaching it from the cameras and vehicular sensors. To address this, we introduce a machine learning forecaster as a part of the edge twin which is responsible for predicting the future location of vehicles. Lastly, we introduce a box algorithm that will use the forecasted values to create a hazard map for the road segment which would be used by the framework to suggest safe manoeuvres for the autonomous vehicles such as lane changes and accelerations. We present the complete fog computing framework for autonomous driving assist and evaluate key portions of the proposed framework using simulations based on a real-world dataset of vehicle position traces on a highway.",

      "Title": "OCoR: An Overlapping-Aware Code Retriever",
      "Abstract": " 2020 ACM.Code retrieval helps developers reuse code snippets in the open-source projects. Given a natural language description, code retrieval aims to search for the most relevant code relevant among a set of code snippets. Existing state-of-the-art approaches apply neural networks to code retrieval. However, these approaches still fail to capture an important feature: overlaps. The overlaps between different names used by different people indicate that two different names may be potentially related (e.g., 'message' and 'msg'), and the overlaps between identifiers in code and words in natural language descriptions indicate that the code snippet and the description may potentially be related. To address this problem, we propose a novel neural architecture named OCoR, where we introduce two specifically-designed components to capture overlaps: the first embeds names by characters to capture the overlaps between names, and the second introduces a novel overlap matrix to represent the degrees of overlaps between each natural language word and each identifier. The evaluation was conducted on two established datasets. The experimental results show that OCoR significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches and achieves 13.1% to 22.3% improvements. Moreover, we also conducted several in-depth experiments to help understand the performance of the different components in OCoR.",

      "Title": "An ai driven real-time 3-D representation of an off-shore WT for fault diagnosis and monitoring",
      "Abstract": " 2019 ACM.In recent years, digital twin (DT) has been an efficient and reliable representation tool for Industry 4.0 in general and fault diagnosis and monitoring, especially in machinery consisting of several components working in tandem that introduce a large amount of data to be processed. Having a cloud-based and platformindependent system that can interpret Big Data in real-time and represent the processed information in a user-friendly manner offers the opportunity not only for improving fault diagnosis and troubleshooting automation, but also offering a better representation of data for operators, technicians and engineers. This not only decreases the repair costs by enabling constant components' state of health awareness, but also increases the efficacy of the apparatus by lowering the downtimes due to faults and issues. In this paper (WindTwin), we propose a real-time, interactive and dynamic 3-D neural-network model that provides important information of a small-scale wind turbine (WT) machinery setup including the state of health of different components (bearings, shafts) based on monitoring sensors (vibrations and temperature) and operations conditions (rotation speed). The system features real-time data processing of six sensors with eight channels including two single axis-accelerometer, one tri-axial accelerometer, one acoustics (microphone), one temperature and one light sensor (for rotational speed) with sampling data collection rate of 51.2 kHz achieved through an edge developed machine learning algorithm based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm using single hidden-layer feed forward neural network (SLFN) and gradient-based backpropagation (BP) training algorithm. The system also provides platformindependent (desktop and mobile companion app) user interfaces thanks to its cloud-based data processing integration. The prototype system proved to have on average 83.33 % accuracy for the vibration-based condition monitoring model across the three different rotation speed of 15Hz, 9Hz and 12Hz with 1 second latency for different fault conditions to be reflected on the DT counterpart.",

Publication rights licensed to ACM.By providing a consolidated access point to information of devices and systems, digital twins enable new, data-intensive use cases for the industrial internet of things (IIoT), like predictive plant and product design. However, the lack of interoperability between the digital twins of different companies hinders use cases that require information exchange between different organizations. Achieving interoperability among digital twins requires transforming the included information to other formats. In this paper, we present requirements and a solution to enable interoperable digital twins by transforming their information models in a flexible way. We illustrate how we applied our solution to a real-world application example in an industrial context by transforming ABB Ability\u2122 digital twins to the Asset Administration Shell format. We show that our customizable transformation system paves the way for on demand interoperability and thereby enables advanced use cases in the IIoT.",

In contrast to industrial robots, the development of service robots comes with severe software engineering challenges, since they require high levels of robustness and autonomy to operate in highly heterogeneous environments. As a domain with critical safety implications, service robotics faces a need for sound software development practices. In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study to assess the state of the art and practice of robotics software engineering. We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with industrial practitioners working in 15 companies from 9 different countries and a survey with 156 respondents from 26 countries from the robotics domain. Our results provide a comprehensive picture of (i) the practices applied by robotics industrial and academic practitioners, including processes, paradigms, languages, tools, frameworks, and reuse practices, (ii) the distinguishing characteristics of robotics software engineering, and (iii) recurrent challenges usually faced, together with adopted solutions. The paper concludes by discussing observations, derived hypotheses, and proposed actions for researchers and practitioners.",

      "Abstract": " 2020 ACM.Digital twins emerge in many disciplines to support engineering, monitoring, controlling, and optimizing cyber-physical systems, such as airplanes, cars, factories, medical devices, or ships. There is an increasing demand to create digital twins as representation of cyber-physical systems and their related models, data traces, aggregated data, and services. Despite a plethora of digital twin applications, there are very few systematic methods to facilitate the modeling of digital twins for a given cyber-physical system. Existing methods focus only on the construction of specific digital twin models and do not consider the integration of these models with the observed cyber-physical system. To mitigate this, we present a fully model-driven method to describe the software of the cyber-physical system, its digital twin information system, and their integration. The integration method relies on MontiArc models of the cyber-physical system's architecture and on UML/P class diagrams from which the digital twin information system is generated. We show the practical application and feasibility of our method on an IoT case study. Explicitly modeling the integration of digital twins and cyber-physical systems eliminates repetitive programming activities and can foster the systematic engineering of digital twins.",

Automatic Building detection and Energy Model creation (AutoBEM) has created 178,368 building energy models for the Electric Power Board (EPB) of Chattanooga, TN, and compared simulation performance to 15-minute data from each building. These models leverage several data sources (e.g. imagery, GIS, utility), software tools to extract building properties (e.g. footprint, height, fa\u00e7ade type, window-to-wall ratio, occupancy, building type), simulate at scale on two of the world's #1 fastest supercomputers, and provide web-based visual analytics. Grid-interactive efficient buildings offer the potential to reduce utility and rate-payer energy costs during each calendar month's hour of critical generation - when the least efficient, most costly, and often dirtiest generation assets must be brought online. In this paper, EnergyPlus is used to simulate over 150,000 buildings to assess the technical potential of utility-controlled smart thermostats. This is analyzed under a couple scenarios leveraging buildings as thermal batteries via pre-conditioning to coast through peak hours.

      "Abstract": " 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.Anomaly analysis of trajectories is one of the means to maintain indoor safety. Effective track anomaly detection should be based on the current road network structure. However, the indoor environment usually contains many obstacles flexible to move. The changes in the positions of obstacles frequently cause the changes of the road network structure. When the road network changes, it takes time and effort to manually redraw the road network and simultaneously losses the guarantee of real-time performance. At the same time, manual drawing is forbidden in some confidential places. In our paper, the scheme of RFID track anomaly detection combined with digital-twin technology is proposed to provide a real-time actual road network for anomaly analysis. The accurate mapping and virtual simulation functions of digital-twin technology are used to achieve the dynamic real-time rendering and the maintenance of the indoor road network structure. We also improve a clustering algorithm to make it suitable for indoor RFID track clustering. In our paper, deviation thresholds and digital-twin model are used to detect anomalies. The trajectory is judged to be abnormal when it appears in the restricted areas or exceeds the deviation thresholds in any terms of position, velocity, or direction. We use an improved scan-line algorithm and F1-scores to determine the threshold values. Our proposed anomaly detection method provides more effective and intuitive results for researchers to analyze.",

This is grounded in New Materialism\u2019s picture of a world understood through entanglement, through resonant constellations, through a multiplicity of unique individual viewpoints and their relationships. These perspectives are especially relevant for design ethnography, in particular for research around smart connected products, which collect data about their environment, the networks they are a part of, and the ways they are used. However, we are concerned about the current trend of many connected systems towards surveillance capitalism, as data is colonised, machinations are hidden, and a narrow definition of value is extracted. There is a key tension that while design, particularly of networked objects, attempts to go beyond human centeredness, the infrastructures that support it are moving towards a less than human perspective in their race to accumulate and dispossess. Our work tries to imagine the situations where participants in networked systems are richly engaged, rather than exploited. We hope for a future where human agency is central to a respectful and acceptable collaborative development of understanding.",

Students will be able to perform different kinds of experiments directly in virtual reality. To diminish the disadvantage of a pure virtual experience, a process log of the experiment is created which gets carried out asynchronously by a robotic arm. The students receive data and a webcam recording of the real world experiment as feedback. We hope to combine the benefits of virtualization and remote controlled labs to overcome most of the typical problems inherent to lab-based learning. The effect on the learning outcome will be evaluated over a period of two years.",

      "Abstract": " 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.Social media are increasingly used to collect data and report on the personal health status, on health issues, symptoms and experiences with treatments. The health data that is, thus, becoming available represents a valuable source for continuous health monitoring and prevention, and clinical decision making. Detecting diseases at early stage can help to overcome and treat them accurately. Social media data can be used to understand, in near real time, human life dynamics worldwide. These massive quantities of data could support in a wide range of medical and healthcare applications, including among others clinical trials and decision support. A Clinical Decision Support System (CDS) can greatly help in identifying diseases and methods of treatment. In this paper we propose a CDS framework that can integrate heterogeneous health data from different sources, such as laboratory test results, basic information of patients, health records and social media data. Using the electronic health medical data so collected, innovative machine learning and deep learning approaches are employed to implement a set of services to recommend a list of diseases and thus assist physicians in diagnosing or treating their patients' health issues more efficiently.",

The question of what will the cities of the future look like is at the heart of urban studies. In parallel, a similar question is posed by (trans)humanists about the future of humanity and its possible technological enhancements. However, (trans)humanity and future cities are defined in a bi-directional dependency. Therefore, we have to answer the questions of future humans and cities simultaneously. This paper maps several ways of interacting between transhuman communities and smart cities to understand their possible effects on governing, design and society at large resulting in a framework that will work as a cautionary tale and an inspirational blueprint for imagining future urbanity.",

      "Abstract": " 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.The concept of Digital Twin has been accepted by more and more researchers and enterprises. Many applications of Digital Twin systems are reported such as airplane state monitor and smart factory. In addition, the digital twin is an important measure to achieve intelligent manufacturing and industry 4.0. The advancement of DT system in manufacturing environment is evident. However, current researches in manufacturing domain concentrated on the discussion of architecture optimization of digital twin system combining with existing cyber-physics researches. There are little research works reported practical DT system and discussed the technologies in implementation. Different from current works, this paper proposed an advanced Digital Twin system for CNC machine tool and discussed the critical enablers to make the DT system more practicality. First, data stream from CAD/CAM to CNC is improved with the STEP-NC standard which containing more structured process data to enhance the information in virtual environment to reflect the real machining process. Second, hardware connection method with CNC system is summarized and a uniform interface for data accessing is proposed to simplify the development of DT system. At last, a virtual machining environment (software named \u201cGrapeSim\u201d) is presented which contains three functions: estimating the machining state according to the accessed data from CNC; material removing simulation that synchronous with the real machining process to illustrate the geometry shape of machined workpiece; a web server that allowing other devices to obtain the data in virtual environment as a data source of cloud manufacturing. The whole Digital Twin system is tested in COMAC, the manufacturer of ARJ21 and C919 jetliner, and all functions are proved stable and useful.",

One operator may be responsible for several machines that need to run continuously. Unfortunately, the complexity of the machines and processes increased faster than the improvement in the corresponding interaction technologies. We propose a multi-modal adaptive human computer interface system for the modern industry that relies on position, activity and other relevant contextual information, in order to provide a more flexible interaction in industrial scenarios. Information about the machine, is transmitted to the worker using a vibrotactile display on his wrist whenever the line of sight is broken. The context in which the user and the machine currently reside in, are determined by software artefacts (Apps). We leverage modern software concepts and an App based eco-system platform on the manufacturing shop floor to organize the software systems described in this paper. We evaluate transmitting arbitrary information via vibrotactile displays and come to the conclusion that such a system is feasible in industrial settings and may be beneficial as it has a very low distraction rate.",

From this perspective, CPS is a dynamic entity with rich functions. However, designers may encounter a difficult situation, in which subsequent dynamic changes of the system are discussed and appropriate functionalities are added in the early design phase. Since the digital twin is the digital duplicate of the physical entity, it can dynamically evolve following the product life cycle.

In the light of digital twin concept, the hierarchical high-level models facilitate storage of information from the entire product life cycle.

      "Abstract": " 2019 ACM.A Digital twin is the virtual replica of a physical system. Digital twins are useful because they provide models and data for design, production, operation, diagnostics, and prognostics of machines and products. Traditionally, building a digital twin requires many built-in sensors to monitor various physical phenomena associated with cyber-physical systems such as vibration, energy consumption, etc. However, many legacy manufacturing systems do not have multi-physics sensors built-in by default. Moreover, it might not be feasible to intrusively place sensors in these systems after they are manufactured. To bring the advantages of digitalization to legacy manufacturing systems, this paper contributes with an Internet-of-Things (IoT) based methodology to build digital twins using an indirect medium such as side-channels, which can localize anomalous faults and infer the quality of the products being manufactured while keeping itself up-to-date. We achieve this by exploring and utilizing the side-channels (emissions such as acoustics, power, magnetic, etc.) of the system that unintentionally reveal the cyber and physical state of the system. To validate our methodology, in this paper, we focus on building a digital twin model of a Fused-Deposition Modeling (FDM) based Cartesian additive manufacturing system. The proposed methodology achieves 83.09% accuracy in anomaly localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the possibility of modeling and maintaining a living digital twin of a manufacturing system by extracting information from the side-channels using low-end IoT sensors.",

In this work, we discuss the concepts of Cyber-physical Consistency and Cyber-physical Synchronization for workflows in CPS. Consistency enables verification of the workflow execution by comparing the assumed virtual world outcome with the actual effects in the physical world. Synchronization is used for restoring a consistent state in case of deviations realized by the MAPE-K control loop for self-adaptive systems.

It provides standards for communication and interaction with Things in the IoT in order to address IoT cross-domain and cross-platform interoperability problems and reduce its fragmentation. WoT uses a formal interface description called Thing Description (TD) which describes the offerings of Things to allow the interaction in between Things. Although Things undergo changes with regard to their physical and/or software components and specifications during their lifetime, the WoT TD is currently inteded to be of a static nature. This remains contradictory with the dynamic evolution of Things along their lifecycle. This work researches the lifecycle aspect for Things in the IoT and the different stakeholders influencing Things and respectively their TD. These two concepts were combined to develop a versioning mechanism for a TD through the lifecycle of a Thing.",

      "Abstract": " 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.The prevalence of IoT enabled devices in the home has manifested in buildings as voice and gesture enabled devices that enable functions such as optimizing energy usage and controlling electrical fixtures. However, most of these are fundamentally dissociated from the spatial nature of buildings as they exist in isolation from the building system and other smart devices in the same space. This situation results in user interaction experiences that are convoluted and non-intuitive, negatively affecting their adoption. Meanwhile, Building Information Models, while used extensively in a building\u2019s design and construction phases, remains underutilized in its operation phase. This paper proposes BIM as an \u201coperating system\u201d for smart homes to serve as the foundational platform for smart device applications. Much like the analogous operating system for computers, BIM serves to provide IoT enabled devices access to information and control over various components of the built environment. It is expected that this smart home architecture would enable seamless integration of smart home functionality across devices and buildings to provide residents with contextualized information for optimized security, comfort, and efficiency. Methods for personalizing building performance to users can also be accomplished through the proposed methodology.",

Actionable insights obtained from industrial analytics are one of the pivotal means for achieving intelligent operations and maintenance.

Next, these objects are equipped with global positions data and pinned to semantic and functional enrichment construction places.

The digital twin virtualizes real time traffic information and is displayed before the actual TOR. In the car cockpit an augmented reality headset or a Stereoscopic 3D (S3D) interface can realize the augmentation. As today's hardware has technical limitations, we build an HMD based mock-up. We conducted a user study (N=20) to assess the driver behavior during a TOR. We found that workload decreases and steering performance raise significantly with the proposed system.

Such system controls an underlying factory interacting with sensors, actuators and other systems creating systems-of-systems. A main point of interest is how these components are built and interconnected, i.e. the system's architecture, and how it might be improved to increase reliability and security. Aims: Unfortunately, there is no review available describing and identifying recent research status and progress for such architectures. Thus, in this systematic mapping study, we overview research on architecture for CPS in the context of Industry 4.0. Method: With an initial automatic search and through iterative refining, first results were gathered. Next, forward and backwards snowballing was performed to integrate the results, giving a final population of 213 papers. The output of this study is firstly a categorization and plot of architectural styles. Secondly, the categorization is extended to include security concerns. Results: In general, there is a tendency in proposing solutions in the fields of system and software architecture while other areas are visibly under-researched. Most proposals focus in digital representation, information management and integration of solutions. Conclusions: While a lot of solution proposals for different architectures exist, there are many fields uncovered and most of the solutions still lack of validation and evaluation results. Our findings highlight areas for future research and provide suggestions for investigation approaches.",

      "Abstract": " 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).Recent trends in networking are proposing the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for the control and operation of the network. In this context, ML can be used as a computer network modeling technique to build models that estimate the network performance. Indeed, network modeling is a central technique to many networking functions, for instance in the field of optimization, in which the model is used to search a configuration that satisfies the target policy. In this paper, we aim to provide an answer to the following question: Can neural networks accurately model the delay of a computer network as a function of the input traffic? For this, we assume the network as a black-box that has as input a traffic matrix and as output delays. Then we train different neural networks models and evaluate its accuracy under different fundamental network characteristics: topology, size, traffic intensity and routing. With this, we aim to have a better understanding of computer network modeling with neural nets and ultimately provide practical guidelines on how such models need to be trained.",

Even if mechanisms are available for access revocation, revocations must still be executed manually by an administrator. However, as physical devices become increasingly embedded and interconnected, access control needs to become an integral part of the resources being protected and be generated dynamically by the resources depending on the context in which they are being used. In this paper, we discuss a set of scenarios for access control needed in current and future systems and use that to argue that an approach for resources to generate and manage their access control policies dynamically on their own is needed. We discuss some approaches for generating such access control policies that may address the requirements of the scenarios.",

      "Abstract": " 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.IoT services hosted by low-power devices rely on the cloud infrastructure to propagate their ubiquitous presence over the Internet. A critical challenge for IoT systems is to ensure continuous provisioning of IoT services by overcoming network breakdowns, hardware failures, and energy constraints. To overcome these issues, we propose a cloud-based framework namely SensorClone, which relies on virtual devices to improve IoT resilience. A virtual device is the digital counterpart of a physical device that has learned to emulate its operations from sample data collected from the physical one. SensorClone exploits the collected data of low-power devices to create virtual devices in the cloud. SensorClone then can opportunistically migrate virtual devices from the cloud into other devices, potentially underutilized, with higher capabilities and closer to the edge of the network, e.g., smart devices. Through a real deployment of our SensorClone in the wild, we identify that virtual devices can be used for two purposes, 1) to reduce the energy consumption of physical devices by duty cycling their service provisioning between the physical device and the virtual representation hosted in the cloud, and 2) to scale IoT services at the edge of the network by harnessing temporal periods of underutilization of smart devices. To evaluate our framework, we present a use case of a virtual sensor created from an IoT service of temperature. From our results, we verify that it is possible to achieve unlimited availability up to 90% and substantial power efficiency under acceptable levels of quality of service. Our work makes contributions towards improving IoT scalability and resilience by using virtual devices.",

We focus on a novel approach to automatically generate the virtual environment from specification, taking advantage of engineering data exchange formats. From a security perspective, an identical (in terms of the system's specification), simulated environment can be freely explored and tested by security professionals, without risking negative impacts on live systems. Going a step further, security modules on top of the framework support security analysts in monitoring the current state of CPSs. We demonstrate the viability of the framework in a proof of concept, including the automated generation of digital twins and the monitoring of security and safety rules.",

The malfunction of these CPSs could threaten human life, cause environmental damage and major financial loss [5, 9, 16]. This drives the need for comprehensive methods that support the cross-domain design, development and implementation of safe and secure systems [3, 4].

      "Abstract": " 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.Many concepts of process management are being intensively discussed in current research. The background is often that within the megatrend of digitization, workflows are automated. Furthermore, processes are fundamentally reconsidered in the digital transformation of organizations. What contribution S-BPM can make in the future of digital process management is analyzed in this paper aiming at the anniversary conference of S-BPM. As basis for the analysis serves the idea that, the suitability of BPM concepts (such as S-BPM) for certain application domains depends on essential process properties. Based on an assessment model we analyze under what conditions subject orientation can be well used (e.g., focus on collaboration). Using these results, we are evaluating the opportunities of S-BPM for the digital future. The evaluation is based on the three exemplary trends (i) digital development/products, (ii) digital production and (iii) digital business transformation. In these trend, we asses which conditions change (e.g. fast changing environments, machine-To-machine-communication, user-centered thinking) and to what degree S-BPM can still contribute in the new digital world. In a nutshell, our findings reveal that subject orientation is well suited for collaborative processes involving many different human and non-human stakeholders, but has deficiencies when dealing with autonomous and unstructured systems, both upcoming trends in the digital transformation.",

      "Title": "A comparison between discrete analysis and a multiphase approach for predicting heat conduction in packed beds",
      "Abstract": " 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is a Lagrangian approach initially developed for predicting particles flow. The eXtended Discrete Element Method (XDEM) framework, developed at the LuXDEM Research Centre of the University of Luxembourg, extends DEM by including the thermochemical state of particles, as well as their interaction with a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) domain. The level of detail of its predictions makes the XDEM suite a powerful tool for predicting complex industrial processes like steel making, powder metallurgy and additive manufacturing. Like in any other DEM software, the critical aspect of the simulations is the computation requirement that grows rapidly as the number of particles increases. Indeed, such burden currently represents the main bottleneck to its full exploitation in large-scale scenarios. Digital Twin, a research project founded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), aims at drastically accelerate XDEM through different approaches and make it an effective tool for numerical predictions in industry as well as virtual prototyping. The Multiphase Particle-In-Cell (MP-PIC) method has been introduced for reducing the computation burden of DEM. It has been initially developed for predicting particles flow and uses a two-way transfer of information between the Lagrangian entities and a computation grid. The method avoids explicit contact detection and can potentially achieve a drastic reduction of the time-to-solution respect to DEM. The present contribution introduces a multiphase approach for predicting the conductive heat transfer within a static packed bed of particles. Results from a test case are qualitatively and quantitatively compared against reference XDEM predictions. The method can be effectively exploited in combination with MPPIC for predicting the thermochemical state of particles.",

The development and testing of a software stack that implements these capabilities over an expensive physical production infrastructure is not cost-effective, and in the early stages, may potentially cause service disruptions. To address these aspects, we develop the Virtual Federated Science Instrument Environment (VFSIE), a digital twin of the physical infrastructure that emulates a multi-site federation. Each federated site is emulated using containers and virtual hosts that are connected over local-area networks, and the sites, in turn, are connected over an emulated wide-area network. We describe the framework design and implementation details. We also illustrate its application by emulating a federation of four laboratories that use Jupyter Notebook for computations and the EPICS software system for instrument control.",

      "Abstract": " 2013 IEEE.The rapid advancements in computing, storage, communications, and networking technologies have enabled the creation of Digital Twins (DTs). A DT is a digital representation of a real-world physical component, product, or equipment. A DT can be used for 3-D design, testing, simulation, and prototyping prior to the manufacturing of the physical component. Once a physical component is in operation, a DT can be used for configuration, monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics. It is expected that DTs will gain significant attention in the foreseeable future, and will play a key role in Industry 4.0. However, today's approaches, systems, and technologies leveraged for the creation of DTs are mostly centralized and fall short of providing trusted data provenance, audit, and traceability. Also, data related to transactions, logs, and history are not secure or tamper-proof. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based creation process of DTs to guarantee secure and trusted traceability, accessibility, and immutability of transactions, logs, and data provenance. Our proposed approach uses smart contracts to govern and track transactions initiated by participants involved in the creation of DTs. Our approach also employs decentralized storage of interplanetary file systems to store and share DTs data. Moreover, we present details on our system design and architecture, implementation, and algorithms. Furthermore, we provide security and cost analysis, and show how our approach fulfills the requirements of DTs process creation. We make the smart contract code for creating DTs publicly available on Github.",

      "Abstract": " 2013 IEEE.A transparent digital twin (DT) is designed for output control using the belief rule base (BRB), namely, DT-BRB. The goal of the transparent DT-BRB is not only to model the complex relationships between the system inputs and output but also to conduct output control by identifying and optimizing the key parameters in the model inputs. The proposed DT-BRB approach is composed of three major steps. First, BRB is adopted to model the relationships between the inputs and output of the physical system. Second, an analytical procedure is proposed to identify only the key parameters in the system inputs with the highest contribution to the output. Being consistent with the inferencing, integration, and unification procedures of BRB, there are also three parts in the contribution calculation in this step. Finally, the data-driven optimization is performed to control the system output. A practical case study on the Wuhan Metro System is conducted for reducing the building tilt rate (BTR) in tunnel construction. By comparing the results following different standards, the 80% contribution standard is proved to have the highest marginal contribution that identifies only 43.5% parameters as the key parameters but can reduce the BTR by 73.73%. Moreover, it is also observed that the proposed DT-BRB approach is so effective that iterative optimizations are not necessarily needed.",

A skillful reaction of simulated robots to unpredicted contact forces has become an especially stringent necessity to support the development of emerging applications for which a compliant robotic manipulation is indispensable. This paper focuses on the simulation of physics-based virtual testbeds in which simulated robots are made capable of accommodating external forces exerted by the environment on their manipulators. For this, we integrate methods from multi-body dynamics modeling, advanced robotics, and virtual reality to develop a robotics simulation basis that facilitates the employment of compliant robotic manipulations in simulated applications. The validation of this basis in joint space indicates that a physics-based simulation of robots endowed with active physical interaction control can capture and reflect significant effects which characterize the interactive behavior of physical compliant robots.We demonstrate the practical utility of our approach to unlock competitive advantages in fully simulated applications prone to position uncertainty. Furthermore, we show the potential of using compliant digital twins of physical robots to introduce compliant robotic manipulations into real applications.",

Digital twins further increase a product's value, making it critical to secure the link between the physical and digital world. An entire industry has sprung up to address this problem with a wide variety of product-authentication technologies, or crypto anchors, offering many different trade-offs between supported product surface, security level, price sensitivity, ease of use, etc. Each crypto-anchor vendor provides their own APIs for commissioning, verification and monitoring which makes it hard for application developers to support many of them. This paper introduces a platform that provides a generic model of an object secured by a crypto anchor, supporting any number of product authentication technologies by means of crypto-anchor plugins. Applications programmed against this generic model can immediately interoperate with any of the plugged-in crypto anchors. We present a blockchain architecture for the platform whose decentralization matches the highly differentiated industry structure. We've implemented the system on Hyperledger Fabric.",

The platform is composed of simulation system, physical UAV and service center, which is designed to solve the problem about UAV advanced capability training and algorithm verification. As we know, a good UAV system verification method is to make full use of virtual simulation before repeated physical tests. However, there is a gap between the virtual simulation and physical test results, because the simulation model is difficult to completely describe the actual physical object. So the hidden risks may exist in actual physical tests by only using the results of virtual simulations. Based on the feedback control idea, the actual state data of the physical UAV is fed back to virtual simulation platform, and the virtual simulation platform completes virtual and real joint training and verification based on this. That is, the technology of digital twin is introduced into the UAV system development process in this paper. In addition, the digital twin platform structure of two-way interaction between virtual space, physical space and service center is proposed. The 4G/5G communication interface is developed to improve the platform's real-time interaction capabilities. Besides, the components of the platform and the construction process are introduced in detail. Finally, three platform test experiments are used to verify the interactive characteristics of the platform and introduce the operating process of the platform.",

However, this equipment is quite expensive which forces some institutions to seek other alternatives or forego them altogether. In addition, online courses tend to be light on hardware because of the practical and technical challenges associated with running remote hardware-based laboratories. Therefore, a system is needed that allows students who are enrolled in remote courses to experience hardware-intensive classes just as they would an in-person course (especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic). In this work, use virtual and augmented reality to build and test a remote UR-10 robotics lab that allows students to work together on a hands-on robotics-based lab. In the future, we plan to demonstrate its technical and pedagogical suitability by running a user study in a real-world class whereby remote students enrolled in a course will participate in a series of experiments to control a UR-10 robot arm. It opens up avenues to explore the advantages and shortcomings of running coordinated group lab exercises between students from different institutions, time-zones, and continents by time-decoupling the schedules. The use of a Virtual Reality interface coupled with a digital twin of the UR10 robot will allow us to investigate the suitability of different user interfaces, and what VR tools would best facilitate remote group work and faculty instruction.",

The composition of contracts representing the actions of a machine specifies each possible manufacturing process implemented by the machine. Then, automatic synthesis from contracts is used to generate an executable model of the machines composing the plant.

      "Abstract": " 2020 IEEE.A novel cylindrical mode-based measurement and post processing technique has recently been presented that allows data that has been acquired on a non-equally spaced abscissa to be processed rigorously. This technique was initially examined and validated using extensive, empirically derived data. However, the recent development of a digital-twin representation of a far-field antenna measurement system enables further and more detailed validation to be performed with results able to be assessed against a reliable 'truth' model. This paper reports the results of that study presenting new analysis that further verifies the utility and flexibility of the very general error correction measurement and post-processing technique in configurations that hitherto have not been considered.",

For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/As a major challenge and opportunity for traditional manufacturing, intelligent manufacturing is facing the needs of sustainable development in future. Sustainability assessment undoubtedly plays a pivotal role for future development of intelligent manufacturing. Aiming at this, the paper presents the digital twin driven information architecture of sustainability assessment oriented for dynamic evolution under the whole life cycle based on the classic digital twin mapping system. The sustainability assessment method segment of the architecture includes indicator system building, indicator value determination, indicator importance degree determination and intelligent manufacturing project assessing. A novel approach for treating the ambiguity of expert' judgment in indicator value determination by introducing trapezoidal fuzzy number into analytic hierarchy process is proposed, while the complexity of the influence relationship among the indicators is processed by the integration of complex networks modeling and PROMETHEE II for the indicator importance degree determination. A two-stage evidence combination model based on evidence theory is built for intelligent manufacturing project assessing lastly. The presented digital-twin-driven information architecture and the sustainability assessment method is tested and validated on a study of sustainability assessment of 8 intelligent manufacturing projects of an air conditioning enterprise. The results of the presented method were validated by comparing them with the results of the fuzzy and rough extension of the PROMETHEE II, TOPSIS and VIKOR methods, indicator importance degree determining method by entropy and indicator value determining method by accurate expert scoring.",

      "Abstract": " 2001-2012 IEEE.Automation, artificial intelligence and sensor-enabled applications are part of everyday life comprising technical systems that utilize environment-perceiving sensors. Here, rough environments often require robust sensor technologies such as radar, coupled with application-specific software evaluating the measured data. The rising complexity of underlying sensor systems (hard- and software) and complex physical interactions with dynamic environments require development-related validations that use virtual methods primarily focusing on close-to-reality sensor simulation. To allow for a wide range of applications, we propose the use of reusable building blocks that generically model and mimic the physical structure from the real world. This includes the whole path between sensor and 3D environment with respect to sensor-intrinsic characteristics as well as environmental influences such as rain. At the same time, computational scalability of each building block allows physical simulations generating reliable sensor data even in real-time applications. As a result, Digital Twins of relevant components, systems and environments are no longer acting on their own but interacting within Virtual Testbeds allowing for virtual validation of radar-based applications with respect to the operational environment.",

As the complexity of CPS increases, it becomes more challenging to efficiently formalize the integrated multidomain views with flexible automated verification across the entire lifecycle. This article illustrates a model-based systems engineering tool-chain to support CPS development with an emphasis on automated parameter value selection for co-simulation. First, a domain-specific modeling approach is introduced to support the formalizations of CPS artifacts, development processes, and simulation configurations. The domain-specific models are used as the basis to generate a Web-based process management system for automated parameter value selections, which coordinates Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration services of development information and technical resources (models, data, and tools) in order to support automated co-simulation. The services are deployed by a service orchestrator based on a decision-making algorithm for parameter value selection. Finally, developers make use of the WPMS to implement simulations and to select system parameter values for co-simulation automatically. The approach is illustrated by a case study on auto-braking system development and we evaluate the efficiency of this tool-chain by both qualitative and quantitative methods. The results show that parameter values are selected more efficiently and effectively when implementing co-simulations using our tool-chain.",

      "Title": "Symbiotic System of Systems Design for Safe and Resilient Autonomous Robotics in Offshore Wind Farms",
      "Abstract": " 2013 IEEE.To reduce Operation and Maintenance (OM) expenditure on offshore wind farms, wherein 80% of the cost relates to deploying personnel, the offshore wind sector looks to advances in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (RAI) for solutions. Barriers to residential Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) autonomy as a service, include operational challenges in run-time safety compliance, reliability and resilience, due to the complexities of dealing with known and unknown risk in dynamic environments. In this paper we incorporate a Symbiotic System Of Systems Approach (SSOSA) that uses a Symbiotic Digital Architecture (SDA) to provide a cyber physical orchestration of enabling technologies. Implementing a SSOSA enables Cooperation, Collaboration and Corroboration (C3), as to address run-time verification of safety, reliability and resilience during autonomous missions. Our SDA provides a means to synchronize distributed digital models of the robot, environment and infrastructure. Through the coordinated bidirectional communication network of the SDA, the remote human operator has improved visibility and understanding of the mission profile. We evaluate our SSOSA in an asset inspection mission within a confined operating environment. Demonstrating the ability of our SSOSA to overcome safety, reliability and resilience challenges. The SDA supports lifecycle learning and co-evolution with knowledge sharing across the interconnected systems. Our results evaluate both sudden and gradual faults, as well as unknown events, that may jeopardize an autonomous mission. Using distributed and coordinated decision making, the SSOSA enhances the analysis of the mission status, which includes diagnostics of critical sub-systems within the resident robot. This evaluation demonstrates that the SSOSA provides enhanced run-time operational resilience and safety compliance to BVLOS autonomous missions. The SSOSA has the potential to be a highly transferable methodology to other mission scenarios and technologies, providing a pathway to implementing scalable autonomy as a service.",

      "Title": "The Life Cycle State Evaluation of Electrical Equipment based on Digital Twins",
      "Abstract": " 2020 IEEE.Nowadays, with the development of smart technologies, more requirements for the state evaluation of electrical equipment have been raised during the full life cycle. In order to meet these demands, the digital twin is a very suitable technology. The digital twins could understand the state of the physical entities through physical models, sensing data and the big data generated from the product lifecycle, so as to predict, estimate, and analyze the dynamic changes. The digital twin is mainly composed of the information data, data exchange interface and digital model. The information data is obtained from the equipment production, operation and management process, including equipment production information and CAD model, environmental information, pre-test and maintenance data, online monitoring data and various sensor measurement data. It provides a comprehensive description of the actual equipment. The data exchange interface is a standardized information transmission channel, which ensures timely and efficient data transmission at various time periods throughout the life cycle of the equipment. The digital model acquires the date through the date exchange interface, structurally stores the data, establishes a virtual model corresponding to the equipment. In order to build up the digital twin, two main problems should be solved. One is the acquisition and storage of the data, the other is the responding speed of the digital model. In the current equipment management system, the various information data of the equipment entire life cycle are independent of each other, and the data utilization efficiency is quite low. Thus, we put forward the life cycle digital thread for the electrical equipment. It contains not only the data of design, production, installation and operation, but also the virials sensing data, environment date and historical experience data of similar equipment. To solve the problem of the responding speed, the preparatory simulation model has been put forward. In this model, a series of the equipment statues are simulated forward and the results are stored in the digital twin. Based on these simulation results and the simplified physical model, the relationship of the sensing data and the equipment state is build. Then, the relationship is revised and optimized through experiment to make sure of the accuracy of the model. This paper studies the data modelling methods and applies the 'digital twin' to the electrical equipment. It is of great significance for the development of intelligent electrical equipment.",

      "Abstract": "Commercial aircraft are in the process of defining new standards with the introduction of the Airbus A380, which involves the latest digital information techniques, such as the AFDX onboard real-time network. The AFDX standard, a major innovation in aircraft technology, first used with the Airbus A380, introduces telecom Ethernet-based technology, as well as a switch connection topology, rather than part-to-part links or buses. Airbus and CES partnered to develop a general-purpose building block, which allows the simulation, test or connection of any AFDX connected equipment. Integrated into different packages, ranging from the small equipment tester, through the complete aircraft integration test bench, up to the full flight test computer. Hence the name \"AFDX General-Purpose Test Platform\". In the flight test applications, it provides the interface between the AFDX avionic world and the commercial Ethernet switches, through multiple AFDX inputs to a twin Ethernet output router. Redundancy and precise time control of the data transmission have been incorporated in the specification. Also of special interest, is a very advanced source synchronized datation system able to guarantee a perfect time alignment of all data directly at the entry in the flight test computer. This paper will describe the different modular elements of the ground and flight test computers, as well as the hardware and software tuning and performance analysis tools, which have been developed around these computers. All of these elements are now in operation and have shown that AFDX tools are a real concept, which can be reused for other programs. 2004 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": " 2021 IEEE.Microgrids are smart electrical grid composed of the communication network among its power devices for better operation and control. The information sharing is done locally through measurement but globally by adopting a protocol over the communication network for fast and reliable information exchange for microgrid protection and coordination among the devices present in the power network. In this article, a real-time simulation of a smart microgrid with the emulation of the intelligent electronic devices present in the grid that takes action over the events is proposed using the hardware-in-the-loop methodology. The information exchange between the simulated microgrid and the emulated intelligent trip unit of the circuit breaker is adopted using a physical communication network and User datagram protocol over Ethernet. The unique aspect is to approach the problem of co-simulating the power system simulator with the communication network without platform dependencies to obtain more realistic results. The mathematical models are created using model-based design approach with which a C code can be generated and can be simulated in real-time with any of the digital twins available. The proposed framework is used to test a protection scenario in the microgrid that exchanges the information over Ethernet for measurement and action coordination with the emulated trip unit for stable operation of the microgrid.",

      "Abstract": " 2021 IEEE.Currently, a large number of power electronic (PE) devices are integrated into distribution power systems. Using traditional digital simulation software and hardware offline testing platforms, it is difficult to achieve real-time monitoring and diagnostics on the various PE devices due to the complex dynamics. In this paper, a novel method, namely the real-time field-programmable gate array-digital twin (FPGA-DT), is proposed and applied on the monitoring and diagnostics of power electronic transformer (PET). The method is developed by generating and evaluating difference vectors of the results, which are obtained from the actual system and its FPGA digital twin respectively. Then, the vector calculation is performed for the standard logic of the monitoring and diagnostics. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by performing four scenarios including sudden load, photovoltaic shadow, three-phase short-circuit and single-phase short-circuit.",

      "Abstract": " 2021 IEEE.This paper presents a networked hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation system for modeling large-scale power systems. Researchers have developed many HIL test systems for power systems in recent years. Those test systems can model both microsecond-level dynamic responses of power electronic systems and millisecond-level transients of transmission and distribution grids. By integrating individual HIL test systems into a network of HIL test systems, we can create large-scale power grid digital twins with flexible structures at required modeling resolution that fits for a wide range of system operating conditions. This will not only significantly reduce the need for field tests when developing new technologies but also greatly shorten the model development cycle. In this paper, we present a networked OPAL-RT based HIL test system for developing transmission-distribution coordinative Volt-VAr regulation technologies as an example to illustrate system setups, communication requirements among different HIL simulation systems, and system connection mechanisms. Impacts of communication delays, information exchange cycles, and computing delays are illustrated. Simulation results show that the performance of a networked HIL test system is satisfactory.",

      "Title": "Hierarchical Aggregation/Disaggregation for Adaptive Abstraction-Level Conversion in Digital Twin-Based Smart Semiconductor Manufacturing",
      "Abstract": " 2013 IEEE.In smart manufacturing, engineers typically analyze unexpected real-time problems using digitally cloned discrete-event (DE) models for wafer fabrication. To achieve a faster response to problems, it is essential to increase the speed of DE simulations because making optimal decisions for addressing the issues requires repeated simulations. This paper presents a hierarchical aggregation/disaggregation (A/D) method that substitutes complex event-driven operations with two-layered abstracted models-single-group mean-delay models (SMDMs) and multi-group MDMs (MMDMs)-to gain simulation speedup. The SMDM dynamically abstracts a DE machine group's behaviors into observed mean-delay constants when the group converges into a steady state. The MMDM fast-forwards the input lots by bypassing the chained processing steps in multiple steady-state groups until it schedules the lots for delivery to subsequent unsteady groups after corresponding multi-step mean delays. The key component, the abstraction-level converter (ALC), has the roles of MMDM allocation, deallocation, extension, splitting, and controls the flow of each group's input lot by deciding the destination DE model, SMDM, and MMDMs. To maximize the reuse of previously computed multi-step delays for the dynamically changing MMDMs, we propose an efficient method to manage the delays using two-level caches. Each steady-state group's ALC performs statistical testing to detect the lot-arrival change to reactivate the DE model. However, fast-forwarding (FF) results in incorrect test results of the bypassed group's ALCs due to the missed observations of the bypassed lots. Thus, we propose a method for test-sample reinitialization that considers the bypassing. Moreover, since a bypassed group's unexpected divergence can change the multi-step delays of previously scheduled events, a method for examination of FF history is designed to trace the highly influenced events. This proposed method has been applied in various case studies, and it has achieved speedups of up to about 5.9 times, with 2.5 to 8.3% degradation in accuracy.",

      "Abstract": " 2007-2012 IEEE.Due to the complicated structure of the aircraft engine, it is hard to observe the damage and determine its status with the traditional diagnosis method, which sets a fixed threshold for some specific parameters. To accurately reflect the condition of the engine, this article provides a novel fault diagnosis method for the TFE-731 turbofan engine and develops an online diagnosis system. With the combinations of model-based and data-driven approaches, models are constructed to create the so-called digital twins of the engine parameters. For the model-based approach, the physical isentropic compression is used as the basis of the model. For the data-driven approach, the fast orthogonal search is utilized to ensure that the model outputs close to the real engine data. Based on the model prediction-based monitoring strategy, the status of the engine can be identified online. By using the proposed method, an alarm will be triggered once the tested engine outputs cross the boundaries generated by the digital twins. This method can be further applied in quality control to examine the abnormal parts of an aircraft engine. Finally, the digital twins' online diagnosis system is realized in the practical TFE-731 test facility, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Flow differences in various server and rack configurations using the detailed digital twin models have been compared with the baseline simplified model in hot aisle containment and no containment data center. Flow rate reduction using the detailed model could be 42% in certain servers within the rack in the non-containment data center. It could further decrease to 50% in hot aisle containment data center compared to a simplified model \u2013 highlighting the importance of accurate digital twin models for data center planning. Additionally, the impact of server location within the rack has been studied. The study shows that servers placed lower in the rack have a higher flow rate reduction, which is not represented using a simplified model.",

      "Abstract": " 1986-2012 IEEE.SDVN is a promising architecture to extend the computation resources which break through the limitations of current vehicular networks. It is possible to learn new networking schemes by observing the surrounding environment in SDVN. However, within SDVN, the construction and application of such schemes still lack proper consideration in data collection, prediction, verification, and validation before applying these schemes in the real network, which is due to the limited knowledge of the physical environment. Intelligent Digital Twin (IDT) was initially designed for realizing intelligent manufacturing by virtualizing and learning the data of the physical space in cyberspace. Hence, bringing IDT to networking can provide additional valuable functionalities to meet the above considerations by constructing a virtual intelligent network space, aiming to realize the iterative update of the networking schemes in an adaptive way. In this article, we introduce a new network architecture, IDT-SDVN, by maximizing the advantages of SDVNs. We present the challenges and open issues of IDT-SDVNs. A case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of SDVNs. The experimental results show that significant improvement of performance is achieved for vehicular networking with the proposed IDT-SDVNs.",

Automakers aim to improve development efficiency of the automotive cyber-physical systems in the fierce market competition. However, the actual development process suffers from the challenges of long development cycle and poor scalability. To tackle these challenges, this article develops a digital twinning based adaptive development environment for automotive cyber-physical systems, which addresses two critical problems: each physical entity (i.e., electronic control unit, component, test source, etc.) needs to clone a corresponding digital twin; digital twins and the physical entities need to interact closely. The first problem is addressed through proposing an integrated digital twinning clone flow. The second problem is addressed through developing a smart digital twinning board. Our case study with the automotive body control system demonstrates that the adaptive development environment achieves a high adaptability with short development cycle, low complexity, low cost, high scalability, and high flexibility, which meet various automotive cyber-physical design requirements during the development process.",

      "Abstract": " 2014 IEEE.The decreasing trend in the price of computational power has led to the evolution of various tools intended to support development processes in power electronics. In the domain of high-power converters, which rely on the use of digital controllers while switching at frequencies not exceeding several kHz, Hardware-In-The-Loop (HIL) systems have become widely adopted for commissioning and testing of control software. To put it differently, analog simulators or scaled-down versions of the same highpower converters have been replaced with HIL systems lately. Owing to the availability of computational power, HIL systems provide the means for high-fidelity real time simulations of the converter hardware parts. Connecting the dedicated controller, supposed to govern the hardware parts, to the Real-Time Simulator (RTS), through a suitable interface, gives control engineers the possibility to explore performances of various control algorithms without the controller ever realizing it drives the converter model, running on the employed RTS, instead of the real power hardware. Consequently, a risk-free environment for development and testing of control schemes is ensured, which is crucial especially if large and expensive systems, such as MW level power electronics converters, are considered. What is more, development of control algorithms and converter hardware parts can take place in parallel, as depicted in Figure 1, which reduces the development time of the converter as a whole.",

      "Abstract": " 2019 IEEE.Attention to cyber security of cyber-physical systems (CPS) has led to the development of innovative cyber-resilient methodologies to ensure early detection and mitigation of cyber anomalies and threats. The concept of Digital Twin (DT) has recently emerged as one of the approaches to achieve the objective of resilience. In the approach using DT, a software-based live model of a target CPS is used to continuously monitor, surveil and verify the correctness of the target CPS operation. In this paper, we empirically study the effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based models as the basis of DT-based resilience. We uncover the important characteristics of an RNN-based solution with experimentation on a lab-scale Canal Lock CPS emulator with live validations and attack scenarios. For the first time, we demonstrate actual, real-time use of a RNN-based model as a DT for performing live analysis on an operational CPS. Based on the observed results, we highlight the importance of a DT model's training interval, prediction interval and CPS polling interval in the process of anomaly detection. We uncover the limitations in anomaly detection due to real-time synchronization needs of the RNN-based DT. We highlight this uncovered tug of war between synchronization and anomaly detection is inherent in any complex CPS that is monitored and synchronized by relying on the same sensor streams of ground truth for both synchronization as well as anomaly detection.",

      "Abstract": " 2013 IEEE.The past years have witnessed an increasing interest and concern regarding the development of security monitoring and management mechanisms for Critical Infrastructures, due to their vital role in ensuring the availability of many essential services. This task is not easy due to the specific characteristics of such systems, and the natural resistance of Critical Infrastructures operators against actions implying downtime. Digital Twins, as accurate virtual models of physical objects or processes, can provide a faithful environment for security analysis or evaluation of potential mitigation strategies to be deployed in face of specific situations. Nonetheless, their on-premises deployment can be expensive, implying a significant CAPEX whose return will depend on the ability to plan and deploy a suitable support infrastructure, as well as implementing efficient and scalable data collection and processing mechanisms capable of taking advantage of the acquired resources. This paper presents an off-premises approach to design and deploy Digital Twins to secure critical infrastructures, developed in the scope of the ELEGANT project. Such Digital Twins are built using real-time, high fidelity replicas of Programming Logic Controllers, coupled with scalable and efficient data collection processes, supporting the development and validation of Machine Learning models to mitigate security threats like Denial of Service attacks. The validation approach of ELEGANT, which leveraged from the capabilities of the Fed4Fire federated testbeds evaluated the feasibility of using cloudified Digital Twins, thus converting a significant part of the projected CAPEX for the in-premises model into on-demand, pay-as-you-go OPEX, eventually paving the way for the establishment of a DTaaS (Digital Twin as a Service) paradigm. The achieved results demonstrate that the data pipelines providing support for the ELEGANT Digital Twins have low impact in terms of resource usage in Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service attack scenarios, when higher volumes of data are generated.",

However, Industrial Hemp Supply Chain (IHSC) faces critical challenges, including high complexity and variability, very limited production knowledge, and lack of data/information tracking. In this paper, we propose blockchain-enabled IHSC and develop a preliminary simulation-based digital twin for this distributed cyber-physical system (CPS) to support the process learning and risk management. Basically, we develop a two-layer blockchain with proof of authority smart contract, which can track the data and key information, improve the supply chain transparency, and leverage local authorities and state regulators to ensure the quality control verification. Then, we introduce a simulation-based digital twin for IHSC management, which can characterize the process spatial-temporal causal interdependencies and dynamic evolution to guide risk control and decision making. Our empirical study demonstrates the promising performance of proposed platform.",

However, this makes ICS more connected to communication networks that provide a potential platform for attackers to intrude into the systems and cause damage and catastrophic consequences. In this paper, we propose implementing digital twins that have been equipped with an intrusion detection algorithm. Our novel algorithm is able to detect attacks in a timely manner and also diagnose the type of attack by classification of different types of attacks. With digital twins, which are a new concept in ICS, we have virtual replicas of physical systems so that they precisely mirror the internal behavior of the physical systems. So by placing the intrusion detection algorithm in digital twins, security tests can be done remotely without risking negative impacts on live systems.",

      "Abstract": " 1986-2012 IEEE.Digital Twin is a new concept that consists of creating an up-to-date virtual asset in cyberspace which mimics the original physical asset in most of its aspects, ultimately to monitor, analyze, test, and optimize the physical asset. In this article, we investigate and discuss the use of the digital twin concept of the roads as a step toward realizing the dream of smart cities. To this end, we propose the deployment of a Digital Twin Box to the roads that is composed of a 360\u00b0 camera and a set of IoT devices connected to a Single Onboard Computer. The Digital Twin Box creates a digital twin of the physical road asset by constantly sending real-time data to the edge/cloud, including the 360\u00b0 live stream, GPS location, and measurements of the temperature and humidity. This data will be used for realtime monitoring and other purposes by displaying the live stream via head-mounted devices or using a 360\u00b0 web-based player. Additionally, we perform an object detection process to extract all possible objects from the captured stream. For some specific objects (person and vehicle), an identification module and a tracking module are employed to identify the corresponding objects and keep track of all video frames where these objects appeared. The outcome of the latter step would be of utmost importance to many other services and domains such as national security. To show the viability of the proposed solution, we have implemented and conducted real-world experiments where we focus more on the detection and recognition processes. The achieved results show the effectiveness of the proposed solution in creating a digital twin of the roads, a step forward to enable self-driving vehicles as a crucial component of smart mobility, using the Digital Twin Box.",

      "Abstract": " 2020 IEEE.During the last decade, utility companies around the world have experienced a significant increase in the occurrences of either planned or unplanned blackouts, and microgrids have emerged as a viable solution to improve grid resiliency and robustness. Recently, power converters with grid-forming capabilities have attracted interest from researchers and utilities as keystone devices enabling modern microgrid architectures. Therefore, proper and thorough testing of Grid-Forming Inverters (GFMIs) is crucial to understand their dynamics and limitations before they are deployed. The use of closed-loop real-time Power Hardware-in-the-Loop (PHIL) simulations will facilitate the testing of GFMIs using a digital twin of the power system under various contingency scenarios within a controlled environment. So far, lower to medium scale commercially available GFMIs are difficult to interface into PHIL simulations because of their lack of a synchronization mechanism that allows a smooth and stable interconnection with a voltage source such as a power amplifier. Under this scenario, the use of the well-known Ideal Transformer Method to create a PHIL setup can lead to catastrophic damages of the GFMI. This paper addresses a simple but novel method to interface commercially available GFMIs into a PHIL testbed. Experimental results showed that the proposed method is stable and accurate under standalone operation with abrupt (step) load-changing dynamics, followed by the corresponding steady state behavior. Such results were validated against the dynamics of the GFMI connected to a linear load bank.",

      "Title": "Optimal RUL Estimation: A State-of-Art Digital Twin Application; Optimal RUL Estimation: A State-of-Art Digital Twin Application",
      "Abstract": " 2020 IEEE.A real world Industrial IoT set up has paved way for simultaneous monitoring of several sensors at their unique sampling rates. This has realized the need for artificial intelligence tools for robust data processing. However, the large size of input data requires real time monitoring and synchronization for online analysis. As the star concept behind the Industry 4.0 wave, a digital twin is a virtual, multi-scale and probabilistic simulation to mirror the performance of its physical counterpart and serve the product lifecycle in a virtual space. Evidently, a digital twin can proactively identify potential issues with its corresponding real twin. Thus, it is best suited for enabling a physics-based and data-driven model fusion to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of the components. Traditional RUL prediction approaches have assumed either an exponential or linear degradation trend with a fixed curve shape to build a Health Index (HI) model. Such an assumption may not be useful for multi-sensor systems or cases where sensor data is available intermittently. A common constraint in the industry is irregular sensor data collection. The resulting asynchronous time series of the sporadic data needs to be an accurate representation of the component's HI when constructing a degradation model. In this paper, we extend the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) technique to generate RUL prediction within a digital twin framework as a means of synchronization with changing operational states. More specifically, we first use LSTM encoder-decoder (LSTM-ED) to train a multilayered neural network and reconstruct the sensor data time series corresponding to a healthy state. The resulting reconstruction error can be used to capture patterns in input data time series and estimate HI of training and testing sets. Using a time lag to record similarity between the HI curves, a weighted average of the final RUL estimation is obtained. The described empirical approach is evaluated on publicly available engine degradation dataset with run-to-failure information. Results indicate a high RUL estimation accuracy with greater error reduction rate. This demonstrates wide applicability of the discussed methodology to various industries where event data is scarce for the application of only data-driven techniques.",

      "Abstract": " 2018 IEEE.Digitalization has shown the potential to disrupt industrial value chains by supporting real-time, risk-free and inexpensive inputs to decision making towards enhanced companies' productivity and value networks flexibility. Developing a reliable and robust digital replica of the physical systems of the value chain is one of the most advanced (and challenging) approaches to digitalization, condensed in the concept of Digital Twin (DT). DT plays a fundamental role in creating a data-rich environment where simulation and optimization procedures can be run. With DT expected to become a commodity in the coming years, simulation and optimization become therefore a more accessible instrument for the improvement of manufacturing and business processes also in small enterprises with limited investment capacity. While scientific literature has analysed the adoption of DT in the optimization of products lifecycle, no contributions have yet focused on the exploitation of DT to improve the sustainability performances of whole value chains. In this paper we propose a reference framework where DTs built upon process and system data gathered from the field, allow to quickly assess the sustainability performances of both existing and planned production mixes and to compare achievable impacts with changing processes and technologies, thus enabling advisory features for sustainability-aware decision making in structured, multi-entity value networks. Internal validation will be deployed referring to real case studies.",

      "Abstract": " 2018 IEEE.Simulation has always played an important role in the development, integration and deployment of aircraft, land vehicles and naval ships. Ever-increasing system design complexity also increased the necessity for more stringent testing and integration capabilities of these new topologies. Real-time simulators can be very useful tools to test, validate and integrate these complex devices. Maintenance and subsystem upgrades, common issues in such complex systems, cannot be easily done on the real systems, especially on larger systems like those in navy ships. This is when a real-time digital replica with Hardware-In-the-Loop capability is very useful. This type of system is also known as a 'Digital Twin'. This approach is compatible with model-based design; a design philosophy that is based entirely on simulation models, from the specifications to release and field commissioning. In this paper, we describe the Digital Twin approach and explain it in the context of navy ships. Such systems usually integrate many subsystems, such as traction systems, power generation and auxiliary systems, all connected through various communication links. The test and integration requirements for such vehicle or land systems affect several levels of the control hierarchy; from low-level power electronic converters used for propulsion and auxiliary systems to high-level supervisory controls. In this paper, we will describe a HIL test made on a simplified zonal power system of a navy ship.",

      "Abstract": " 2014 Chinese Association of Automation.This paper presents an innovative investigation on prototyping a digital twin (DT) as the platform for human-robot interactive welding and welder behavior analysis. This human-robot interaction (HRI) working style helps to enhance human users' operational productivity and comfort; while data-driven welder behavior analysis benefits to further novice welder training. This HRI system includes three modules: 1) a human user who demonstrates the welding operations offsite with her/his operations recorded by the motion-tracked handles; 2) a robot that executes the demonstrated welding operations to complete the physical welding tasks onsite; 3) a DT system that is developed based on virtual reality (VR) as a digital replica of the physical human-robot interactive welding environment. The DT system bridges a human user and robot through a bi-directional information flow: a) transmitting demonstrated welding operations in VR to the robot in the physical environment; b) displaying the physical welding scenes to human users in VR. Compared to existing DT systems reported in the literatures, the developed one provides better capability in engaging human users in interacting with welding scenes, through an augmented VR. To verify the effectiveness, six welders, skilled with certain manual welding training and unskilled without any training, tested the system by completing the same welding job; three skilled welders produce satisfied welded workpieces, while the other three unskilled do not. A data-driven approach as a combination of fast Fourier transform (FFT), principal component analysis (PCA), and support vector machine (SVM) is developed to analyze their behaviors. Given an operation sequence, i.e., motion speed sequence of the welding torch, frequency features are firstly extracted by FFT and then reduced in dimension through PCA, which are finally routed into SVM for classification. The trained model demonstrates a 94.44% classification accuracy in the testing dataset. The successful pattern recognition in skilled welder operations should benefit to accelerate novice welder training.",

      "Abstract": " 2020 IEEE.The rapid evolution of digital technology and designed intelligence, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Big data analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), has been a catalyst for the 4th industrial revolution (known as industry 4.0). Among other, the two key state-of-the-art concepts in Industry 4.0, are Industrial IoT (IIoT) and digital twins. IIoT facilitates real-time data acquisition, processing and analytics over large amount of sensor data streams produced by sensors installed within a smart factory, while the 'digital twin' concept aims to enable smart factories via the digital replication or representation of physical machines, processes, people in cyber-space. This paper explores the capability of present-state open-source platforms to collectively achieve digital twin capabilities, including IoT real-time data acquisition, virtual representation, analytics, and visualisation. The aim of this work is to 'close the gap' between research and implementation, through a collective open source IoT and Digital Twin architecture. The performance of the open-source architecture in this work, is demonstrated in a use-case utilising industry 'open data', and is bench-marked with universal testing tools.",

Like many other educational services, lots of the contents including laboratory studies are switched to remote learning due to COVID-19. In this work, the need for remote laboratory assignments is transformed into an opportunity to use Digital Twins in the education effectively. Laboratory assignments are designed on top of the concept of Digital Twin applications for the course 'ME-142: Mechatronics' at the University of California, Merced. Basic mechatronics simulation skills are enhanced using the foundational applications in MATLAB/Simulink. After students reached high confidence level in the simulation environment, the concept of Digital Twins is introduced for subsequent laboratory assignments consisting identification, modeling, analysis, controller design and validation. Through the end of the semester, students are expected to work in groups of six for the course project to create their own applications of Digital Twin for a variety of systems. Finally, Digital Twin applications are posted online using MATLAB Web App Server to enhance accessibility and compensate the lack of hardware interaction.",

The injection is done at the beginning of a simulation by dynamically rewiring the involved netlists. During the simulation on a realtime platform, faults can be activated or deactivated triggered by sequences, statistical effects or by events from the real world. In some cases the fault structures can even be auto-generated directly from a formal specification, which further automates the development process for safety-relevant systems. The approach is demonstrated at a SystemC/ SystemC AMS virtual prototype of a safety-critical sub-systems which runs on a dSPACE real-time hardware.",

      "Title": "Examination of the Effectiveness of Mode Orthogonalisation and Filtering for Scattering Suppression in Antenna Measurements Through Computational Electromagnetic Simulation; Examination of the Effectiveness of Mode Orthogonalisation and Filtering for Scattering Suppression in Antenna Measurements Through Computational Electromagnetic Simulation",
      "Abstract": " 2019 European Association on Antennas and Propagation.Reflections in antenna measurement ranges generally comprise the most significant term within the overall uncertainty budget [1], [2]. For well over a decade now, a frequency domain mode filtering based measurement technique has been utilized to significantly reduce range reflections within antenna test systems [1], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. More recently however, this technique has been adapted so that it could also be used with far-field and compact antenna measurement systems [9], [10], [1] with the technique being firmly rooted in conventional cylindrical near-field theory [1]. Although this family of techniques was initially intended to provide a means by which the lower frequency limit of operation of a given facility [3], [4] could be extended downwards to work effectively in applications where the operation would otherwise be impaired by the fixed physical size of the absorber and therefore predetermined electrical performance, these techniques have more recently been used very successfully to improve performance at the upper end of the frequency extent [11]. Although this technique has been extensively examined and verified empirically by means of range measurements, relatively little verification by means of computational electromagnetic simulation is available in the open literature [1], [12], [13], [14], [15]. In this paper, we developed an efficient computational electromagnetic (CEM) model of the measurement configuration, i.e. a digital twin, using a three-dimensional, full-wave CEM solver. The purpose of this is to construct an absolute truth-model to provide a firm basis for a detailed quantitative examination of the scattering suppression technique. The modelling technique is discussed in detail and initial results are presented which show very good agreement between the 'true' far-field pattern of the antenna in free space and that of the far-field of the antenna when perturbed with the presence of a scatterer and applying the scattering suppression process.",

      "Abstract": " 1963-2012 IEEE.This article presents a simple instrumentation system for sensing the angular position of a through shaft. The system, broadly, consists of two parts: 1) a Hall-effect-based sensor module (SM) consisting of a twin eccentric-disc rotating arrangement and 2) a linearizing digital converter (LDC), which acts as an efficient interface for the transducer part. The SM provides cubic-natured push-pull outputs with respect to the angle. The linearizer further accepts these signals, performs a voltage-to-frequency transformation, and then applies novel linearization function to render a linear direct-digital indication of the angle. The article discusses the design and theoretical modeling of the SM, and its characteristics are derived. The sensor characteristics observed from simulation are in agreement with theoretical studies. Simulations are also extended to study the effect of important mechanical/magnetic parameters of the SM. Optimal parameter values are also inferred from these studies. The LDC and associated methodologies are also studied and presented in the article. The performance of the instrumentation system is validated using a hardware model of the SM and a prototype of the LDC. The experimental results show that the sensor and linearizer work as expected. Interfacing tests show that the overall instrumentation system gives an accuracy of less than 0.4% and a resolution of 0.2\u00b0 over a wide range.",

      "Abstract": " 1986-2012 IEEE.In this article, an approach is proposed for the online diagnostic analysis of power electronic converters utilizing real-time, probabilistic digital twinning. Under this approach, a digital twin (DT) of a power converter is defined as a real-time, probabilistic simulation model with stochastic (random) variables, developed using generalized polynomial chaos expansion. The DT models are partitioned in perspective of control layers for power converter subsystems in the approach, with emphasis on the application and converter control layers. Real-time executed solvers of these divided probabilistic DT models are embedded into power converter controllers running on field programmable gate array (FPGA) computing devices. Using a monitoring system, the real-time probabilistic DTs at each control layer and the corresponding physical twins of the power converter are compared by the controllers to determine if the power converter is operating within probable behavior. Knowing the large computational cost of probabilistic modeling, the resource usage and timing of real-time DT solvers on modern FPGAs is reported for common power electronic converter topologies, showing the approach is feasible and able to perform probabilistic real-time simulation of smaller power converters in perspective of application and converter control layers using \\leq 2\\; \\mu s time steps, with as low as \\text{70}\\;{\\rm ns} steps; while staying embeddable within FPGA-based controllers. To highlight the capabilities of the proposed approach, a case study is presented using a probabilistic DT in the application layer controller of a pair of converters to comparatively monitor their behavior and corresponding controller action under hardware-in-the-loop testing.",

The hardware platform is coupled with a software interface that implements the required data processing algorithms for the synthesis of the digital predistortion function. Experimental validation is carried out on a 3G power amplifier driven by an eight-carrier WCDMA signal.

      "Abstract": " 2019 IEEE.Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) development approaches tend to start from the physical (hardware) perspective, and the software is the final element in the process. However, this approach is unfit for the more software-intensive world that is increasingly iterative, connected, and constantly online. Many constraints prevent the application of iterative, incremental, and agile development methodologies, which now are the norm for many other fields of software. Time-consuming system validation can only start when both hardware and software components are ready, which implies that the software delivery and quality is almost always the final bottleneck in the CPS development and integration. Also organizational issues raise concerns-CPS development teams are nowadays often geographically distributed, which can result in delays in the process, shortcomings, and even mistakes. In this paper, we propose using our envisioned open-source Virtual Reality-based Integrated software Development Environment (VRIDE) for developing the next generation, increasingly software-intensive CPSs in efficient ways.",

System upgrades require a complete cycle of work on validating both the replaceable components and the changed system itself. The system itself, if it is included in the life cycle of an existing industrial object, actually cannot be used as a testbed of the new components; generally, full-size system layouts are used for the testbed, and the complexity of those layouts may be comparable to the system itself. The inclusion of the digital twin in the life cycle of the object and its control system allows to effectively solve the problem of system modification (individual components replacement) in this case. The digital twin is not only a cheaper analog of the system that can be used for testing; due to the properties that allow parallel testing for several copies and to influence the model time within certain limits, it provides a higher quality of testing.",

      "Abstract": " 2021 IEEE.With increasing interconnectedness and complexity of aerospace systems and system-of-systems, it no longer suffices to perform experimentation and integration without an overarching framework to organize modeling, simulation, and analysis artifacts. With recent advances in Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), several key building blocks for such a framework are already in place. However, important challenges remain. No longer isolated MBSE tools can suffice without a flexible infrastructure to support model integration, tool interoperability, experimentation, and data collection. This recognition provides the impetus for developing a MBSE research testbed for prototyping and evaluating aerospace systems and system-of-systems. This paper presents progress made and lessons learned in the development of a MBSE research testbed for experimentation with aerospace systems such as multi-UAV swarms. Multi-UAV swarms are used in a variety of missions ranging from search and rescue and perimeter security of high value physical assets to emergency response and infrastructure inspection. These operations are characterized by adaptive coordination, ability to survive systemic malfunctions and unexpected external disruptions, ability to discern and reach safe states when attempting to cope with unknown disruptions, ability to course correct and continuously adapt in partially observable, reactive environments. This paper discusses the implementation of digital twin-enabled MBSE testbed which employs a smart dashboard to support experimentation with dynamic scenario execution, monitoring, visualization and control.",

      "Abstract": " 2021 IEEE.Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are susceptible to various anomalies during their operations. Thus, it is important to detect such anomalies. Detecting such anomalies is challenging since it is uncertain when and where anomalies can happen. To this end, we present a novel approach called Anomaly deTection with digiTAl twIN (ATTAIN), which continuously and automatically builds a digital twin with live data obtained from a CPS for anomaly detection. ATTAIN builds a Timed Automaton Machine (TAM) as the digital representation of the CPS, and implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to detect anomalies. GAN uses a GCN-LSTM-based module as a generator, which can capture temporal and spatial characteristics of the input data and learn to produce realistic unlabeled adversarial samples. TAM labels these adversarial samples, which are then fed into a discriminator along with real labeled samples. After training, the discriminator is capable of distinguishing anomalous data from normal data with a high F1 score. To evaluate our approach, we used three publicly available datasets collected from three CPS testbeds. Evaluation results show that ATTAIN improved the performance of two state-of-art anomaly detection methods by 2.413%, 8.487%, and 5.438% on average on the three datasets, respectively. Moreover, ATTAIN achieved on average 8.39% increase in the anomaly detection capability with digital twins as compared with an approach of not using digital twins.",

      "Abstract": " 2021 IEEE.Human-robot collaboration and cooperation are critical for Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) in order to use them in indoor environments, such as offices, hospitals, libraries, schools, factories, and warehouses. Since a long transition period might be required to fully automate such facilities, we have to deploy AMRs while improving safety in the mixed environments of human and mobile robots. In addition, human behaviors in such environments might be difficult to predict. In this paper, we present a Digital Twin for Autonomous Mobile Robots system named DigiMobot to support, manage, monitor, and validate AMRs in indoor environments. First, DigiMobot can simulate human behaviors and robot movements to verify and validate AMRs to improve safety in a virtual world. Secondly, DigiMobot can monitor and manage AMRs in the physical world by collecting sensor data from each robot in real-time. Since DigiMobot enables us to test the robot systems in the virtual world, we can deploy and implement AMRs in each facility without any modifications. To show the feasibility of DigiMobot, we develop a software framework and two different types of autonomous mobile robots. Finally, we conduct real-world experiments in a warehouse located in Saitama, Japan, in which more than 400, 000 items are stored for commercial purposes.",

      "Abstract": " 2021 IEEE.Cybersecurity research regarding the electric power grid has primarily been focused on protecting the communication layer of grid-connected devices against cyber-attack threats. Although many developed methods have greatly reduced the effects of a cyber-attack on the vulnerabilities of grid-connected devices, discovering new vulnerabilities is inevitable and a constant threat. As a result, the overall reliability and security of network communications with regard to grid-connected devices is a concern. This paper proposes a method that further secures a system by focusing on the control and hardware layer of grid-connected devices. The device\u2019s controller firmware will be validated and authenticated using integrated device emulation resources prior to being activated to control the grid-connected device. This verification process is performed while the controller is online and actively controlling power flows related to the device. Therefore, an attack to the system through a malicious firmware patch would be detected by the online security and rejected while safely maintaining continuous and stable control of the device. This method integrates the concepts of firmware hot-patching, digital twins, and active monitoring into an overall cybersecurity protection system.",

The digital twin created used data from a plant currently in operation at the major system, and the automatic rules extraction approach from the test database was used to form the model's knowledge database. The principal component analysis technique was used to reduce the dimensionality of the system to reduce the computational effort of the model. An algorithm for automatic update of rules during the operation of the digital twin was also proposed, making the model learn during the operation even without the need to retrain and, consequently, reduce error of the model's response in the short term.",

      "Abstract": "Speech recognition systems have gained popularity in consumer electronics. This paper presents a custom-designed coprocessor for output probability calculation (OPC), which is the most computation-intensive processing step in continuous hidden Markov model (CHMM)-based speech recognition algorithms. To save hardware resource and reduce power consumption, a polynomial addition-based method is used to compute add-log instead of the traditional look-up table-based method. In addition, the optimal tradeoff between speech processing delay, energy consumption, and hardware resources is explored for the coprocessor. The proposed coprocessor has been implemented and tested in Xilinx Spartan-3A DSP XC3SD3400A, and also validated using the standard-cell-based approach in IBM \u03bcm technology. To implement an entire speech recognition system, SAMSUNG S3C44b0X (containing an ARM7) is used as the micro-controller to execute the rest of speech processing. Tested with a 358-state 3-mixture 27-feature 800-word HMM, S3C44b0X operates at 40 MHz and coprocessor at 10 MHz to meet the real-time requirement, and the recognition accuracy is 95.2%. Power consumption of the micro-controller is 10 mW, and that of the coprocessor 15.2 mW. The overall speech recognition system achieves the lowest energy consumption per word recognition among many reported designs. Experiment and analysis show that the speech recognition system based on the proposed coprocessor is especially suitable for mid-size vocabulary (1001000 words) recognition tasks.  2010 IEEE.",

Therefore, to meet all the aforementioned goals, a reconfigurable hybrid wind farm testbed has been developed and implemented into a real-time simulation platform that has eight CPUs. The proposed wind farm testbed includes a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) system involving a Doubly-fed Induction Machine (DFIM) test setup and wind turbine controllers. The wind farm model is also tested under normal and abnormal grid conditions. Several types of system symmetrical and asymmetrical faults are investigated. The first is a two-phase to ground fault at the point of common coupling (PCC) and the second is a three-phase to ground fault. An innovative approach referred to as Computer Twins is employed to react to these faults and maintain the stability of the power grid. A comprehensive set of test results are presented in this paper to demonstrate the capability of proposed testbed.",

      "Abstract": " 2013 IEEE.A major disadvantage of existing condition monitoring methods is the need for additional sensors and measuring equipment. In this work, this disadvantage is eliminated by completely avoiding additional hardware. Instead, software-based methods from the field of machine learning are used. Therefore, measurement signals and control output variables are utilized, which are acquired and processed in any power electronic system for the purpose of converter control. The publication focuses on two main converter components: power semiconductors and dc-link capacitor. For each component, the aging mechanisms that have been studied in the literature are explained. Based on the aging mechanisms, the degradation indicators are identified. Then, a converter model is built that allows the variation of degradation indicators in order to analyze their effects on the available dataset. These findings form the basis for mathematical models, which detects future failure mechanisms of this type during converter operation. The test setup must offer the possibility of generating reproducible failure cases in various components with the aid of additional failure equipment. Finally, failure mechanisms are intentionally introduced at the test bench in order to validate the methodology of the developed approach.",

      "Abstract": " 2014 IEEE.With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT), the digital twin is emerging as one of the most promising technologies to connect physical components with digital space for better optimization of physical systems. However, the limited wireless resource and security concerns impede the deployment of the digital twin in IoT. In this article, we exploit blockchain to propose a new digital twin edge networks framework for enabling flexible and secure digital twin construction. We first develop cooperative federated learning through an access point (AP) to help resource-limited smart devices in constructing digital twin at the network edges belonging to different mobile network operators (MNOs). Then, we propose a model update chain by leveraging directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain to secure both local model updates and global model updates. In order to incentivize the APs to help in local models training for resource-limited smart devices and also encourage the APs to contribute resource in local model update verification, we design an iterative double auction-based joint cooperative federated learning and local model update verification scheme. The optimal unified time for cooperative federated learning and local model update verification is solved to maximize social welfare. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed scheme is efficient in digital twin construction.",

      "Title": "A Digital-Twin-Assisted Fault Diagnosis Using Deep Transfer Learning",
      "Abstract": " 2013 IEEE.Digital twin is a significant way to achieve smart manufacturing, and provides a new paradigm for fault diagnosis. Traditional data-based fault diagnosis methods mostly assume that the training data and test data are following the same distribution and can acquire sufficient data to train a reliable diagnosis model, which is unrealistic in the dynamic changing production process. In this paper, we present a two-phase digital-twin-assisted fault diagnosis method using deep transfer learning (DFDD), which realizes fault diagnosis both in the development and maintenance phases. At first, the potential problems that are not considered at design time can be discovered through front running the ultra-high-fidelity model in the virtual space, while a deep neural network (DNN)-based diagnosis model will be fully trained. In the second phase, the previously trained diagnosis model can be migrated from the virtual space to physical space using deep transfer learning for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance. This ensures the accuracy of the diagnosis as well as avoids wasting time and knowledge. A case study about fault diagnosis using DFDD in a car body-side production line is presented. The results show the superiority and feasibility of our proposed method.",

      "Abstract": " 2005-2012 IEEE.This article proposes a new form of algorithm environment for the multiobjective optimization of an energy management system in plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs). The surrogate-assisted strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SSPEA) is developed to optimize the power-split control parameters guided by the data from the physical PHEV and its digital twins (DTs). By introducing a 'confidence factor,' the SSPEA uses the fused data of physically measured and virtually simulated vehicle performances (energy consumption and remaining battery state of charge) to converge the optimization process. Gaussian noisy models are adopted to emulate the real vehicle system on the hardware-in-the-loop platform for experimental evaluation. The testing results suggest that the proposed SSPEA requires less R&D costs than the model-free method that only uses the physical information, and more than 44.6% energy can be saved during the R&D process. Driven by the SSPEA, the optimized energy management system surpasses other non-DT-assisted systems by saving more than 4.8% energy.",

      "Abstract": " 2007-2012 IEEE.In a context of growing societal awareness on the carbon footprint and the changing energy landscape, we need to rethink the architecture of future energy systems using new dedicated approaches. Technology advances have shown the relevance of a smart operation of multienergy cyber-physical systems (ME-CPS) requiring a strong cooperation between all players. However, in practice, the different assets that make up ME-CPS are operated by independent entities with different objectives and perspectives in mind. A new methodology is introduced that puts the stakeholders at the center of the design process by assuming that the system will be correctly designed and operated if all stakeholders reach a common agreement using formal contracts, which can be simulated for verification and validation before signature. Models are used to structure the relationships between stakeholders at all stages of the systems lifecycle: formal contracts are derived from high-level goals and are verified using 'digital twins' that include requirement models and behavioral models. This new method was applied within a research project at EDF Lab to coordinate stakeholders for the renovation of a district to make it greener and smarter. Two scenarios were simulated revealing disagreements between stakeholders, and that satisfying ambitious key performance indicators (KPIs) is not an easy task requiring careful cooperation between actors.",

The spacecraft is facing more frequent and multi-task tests in an unprecedented complex environment, which set higher requirements for self-management. The current challenge lies in how to further build an integrated system of the virtual and physical space for spacecraft. In this tendency, the integration of Digital twin(DT) with spacecraft is also in its evolutionary trend. DT provides a data and model-based systematic approach for operation and management in the entire service life of on-orbit spacecraft. In this context, as a basic space system entity, the method of constructing DT of spacecraft is explored in this paper. Firstly, the concept of Spacecraft Digital twin (SDT) is put forward and four stages of simulation development are discussed from the perspective of DT. Moreover, the conceptual structure of four-dimensional model is proposed to adapt spatial distribution. After that, the key problems of SDT are discussed, including data acquisition, system configuration, and data service model. Accordingly, the future intelligent applications of spacecraft based on DT in autonomous cognition, autonomous operation and maintenance, as well as cluster collaboration are presented respectively.",

The MVS is able to produce virtual world information in real-time which can be customized for the robots' workspace. In this environment, the robots can interact with the MVS via high speed serial communication link and behave as if they were swimming in the underwater-world even in the case they are deployed in a simple shaped testing-pool. This world which is virtually created using the sensory information of both the real and a virtual world is called 'synthetic world.' By testing in the synthetic world, the efficiency of underwater systems' development is improved because the software can be developed directly on the embedded computer system and the hardware/software cross-checking can be easily conducted.

The commonly used approach of observing only the loading time is compared to a manual feature engineering approach, a statistical feature extraction and selection approach and an image transformation approach.

Digital twins are useful because they provide models and data for design, production, operation, diagnostics, and autonomy of machines and products. Hence, the digital twin has been projected as the key enabler of the Visions of Industry 4.0. The digital twin concept has become increasingly sophisticated and capable over time, enabled by many technologies. In this paper, we propose the cognitive digital twin as the next stage of advancement of a digital twin that will help realize the vision of Industry 4.0. Cognition, which is inspired by advancements in cognitive science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, will enable a digital twin to achieve some critical elements of cognition, e.g., attention (selective focusing), perception (forming useful representations of data), memory (encoding and retrieval of information and knowledge), etc. Our main thesis is that cognitive digital twins will allow enterprises to creatively, effectively, and efficiently exploit implicit knowledge drawn from the experience of existing manufacturing systems and enable the transfer of higher performance decisions and control and improve the performance across the enterprise (at scale). Finally, we present open questions and challenges to realize these capabilities in a digital twin.",

      "Abstract": " 2020 IEEE.Digital twins and parallel system have already been regarded as one of the most effective approaches that give a great impetus to the development of transportation system, especially for the testing of vehicle intelligence. State synchronization, as the main influencer of real-time interaction in a parallel system, determines the testing accuracy and computational efficiency. Despite the fact that the synchronization control is already a well-explored field, the traffic state synchronization in the application of the vehicle testing via virtual-real interaction is still a topic for further research. In this paper, to achieve better synchronization, a path generation method based on the Frenet frame is firstly designed to decompose the object's motion into the longitudinal and lateral directions, and achieves the trajectory tracking based on the near real-time data sent from the physical space. Then to eliminate the stochastic latency, the advance estimate-based path modification method is proposed to generate a stretch of path in advance. Finally, the integrated approach is implemented in a testing platform and the experimental results prove that the proposed method improves the synchronous rate by an average of 78.4% and 63.7% in the scenario of straight driving and lane changing.",

However, there is a lack of efficient strategies and comprehensive approaches for managing assets and their associated data that can help to monitor, detect, record, and communicate operation and maintenance (O&M) issues. With the importance of Digital Twin (DT) concepts being proven in the architecture, engineering, construction and facility management (AEC/FM) sectors, a DT-enabled anomaly detection system for asset monitoring and its data integration method based on extended industry foundation classes (IFC) in daily O&M management are provided in this study. This paper presents a novel IFC-based data structure, using which a set of monitoring data that carries diagnostic information on the operational condition of assets is extracted from building DTs. Considering that assets run under changing loads determined by human demands, a Bayesian change point detection methodology that handles the contextual features of operational data is adopted to identify and filter contextual anomalies through cross-referencing with external operation information. Using the centrifugal pumps in the heating, ventilation and air-cooling (HVAC) system as a case study, the results indicate and prove that the novel DT-based anomaly detection process flow realizes a continuous anomaly detection of pumps, which contributes to efficient and automated asset monitoring in O&M.",
