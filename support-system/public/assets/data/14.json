      "Abstract": "Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) can be considered as the right tool to reduce the complexity of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) development through its principles of abstraction, separation of concerns, reuse and automation. In this paper we present the results of a systematic mapping study we performed for providing an organized view of existing MDE approaches for designing WSNs. A total number of 780 studies were analysed, among them, we selected 16 papers as primary studies relevant for review. We setup a comparison framework for these studies, and classified them based on a set of common parameters. The main objective of our research is to give an overview about the state-of-the-art of MDE approaches dedicated to WSN design, and finally, discuss emerging challenges that have to be considered in future MDE approaches for engineering WSNs.",

      "Title": "C-MAC: Model-Driven Concurrent Medium Access Control for Wireless Sensor Networks",
      "Abstract": "This paper presents C-MAC, a new MAC protocol designed to achieve high-throughput bulk communication for data-intensive sensing applications. C-MAC exploits concurrent wireless channel access based on empirical power control and physical interference models. Nodes running C-MAC estimate the level of interference based on the physical signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) model and adjust the transmission power accordingly for concurrent channel access. C-MAC employs a block-based communication mode that not only amortizes the overhead of channel assessment, but also improves the probability that multiple nodes within the interference range of each other can transmit concurrently. C-MAC has been implemented in TinyOS-1.x and extensively evaluated on Tmote nodes. Our experiments show that C-MAC significantly outperforms the state-of-art CSMA protocol in TinyOS with respect to system throughput, delay and energy consumption.",

      "Title": "Model-Driven Accuracy Bounds for Noisy Sensor Readings",
      "Abstract": "Wireless sensor networks are increasingly used in application scenarios where a high data quality is inevitable, e.g., the control of industrial production areas. Nevertheless, many deployments must live with strict constraints regarding the sensing hardware and may not employ newest sensing technologies, e.g., due to limited energy budget, size, and bandwidth. Additionally, many applications would benefit from not only gathering absolute sensor readings but also knowing the quality of their low-cost sensor measurements. In this paper, we introduce a model-driven approach that (i) provides reliable accuracy bounds for individual noisy sensor readings and (ii) detects systematic and transient sensor errors. We apply our method to static and mobile real-world deployments of noisy and unstable low-cost sensors by analyzing large sets of urban temperature and ozone measurements. We find that the proposed algorithm successfully calculates precise accuracy bounds. We compare them to measurements of high-quality instruments and show that up to 96 % of the reference measurements are inside the computed accuracy bounds in the static scenario and up to 94 % in the mobile scenario. This is surprisingly high for the used low-cost sensors. By analyzing data from our static longterm deployment, we reveal that the ozone sensor's reliability is dependent on seasonal weather conditions.",

      "Title": "A Sampling-Based Approach to Optimizing Top-k Queries in Sensor Networks",
      "Abstract": "Wireless sensor networks generate a vast amount of data. This data, however, must be sparingly extracted to conserve energy, usually the most precious resource in battery-powered sensors. When approximation is acceptable, a model-driven approach to query processing is effective in saving energy by avoiding contacting nodes whose values can be predicted or are unlikely to be in the result set. To optimize queries such as top-k, however, reasoning directly with models of joint probability distributions can be prohibitively expensive. Instead of using models explicitly, we propose to use samples of past sensor readings. Not only are such samples simple to maintain, but they are also computationally efficient to use in query optimization. With these samples, we can formulate the problem of optimizing approximate top-k queries under an energy constraint as a linear program. We demonstrate the power and flexibility of our sampling-based approach by developing a series of topk query planning algorithms with linear programming, which are capable of efficiently producing plans with better performance and novel features. We show that our approach is both theoretically sound and practically effective on simulated and real-world datasets.",

      "Title": "An efficient data gathering and reconstruction method in WSNs based on compressive sensing",
      "Abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a very simple deterministic measurement matrix design algorithm(SDMMDA), based on which the data gathering and reconstruction in wireless sensor networks(WSNs) are greatly enhanced. Although SDM-MDA is very simple, but the measurement and reconstruction performance is more efficient than the random matrix and the matrix designed by schnass. The basic principle of the proposed algorithm can be stated as follows. First, generating a random redundant matrix Î¦. Second, constructing a Gram matrix G, which can be denoted as Î¦<sup>T</sup> * Î¦. Third, decreasing the absolute value of the off-line entries of the Gram matrix. Finally, mutual coherence of the random measurement matrix can be decreased greatly and the compressive data gathering as well as the signal reconstruction performance are greatly improved simultaneously. Besides that, we adopt backtracking-based adaptive OMP(BAOMP) method to reconstruct the original signal gathered by WSNs. By using BAOMP,We need not to know the signal sparse level K anymore. Extensive simulations and practical experiments of WSNs have shown that reconstruction performance of the compressive data gathered with CS method is improved greatly by using the proposed SDMMDA and BAOMP.",

      "Abstract": "The conventional sensor MAC is unconcerned with data aggregation. Therefore, this paper proposes a new MAC level Data Aggregation (MDA). The goal is to reduce energy consumption in WSN (Wireless Sensor Network). The MDA has two functions that are discriminative to the conventional sensor MAC, in that it achieves efficient aggregation and the avoidance of Network beacon collisions. The MDA is designed considering the type of sensing data used in the network. Therefore, a node sleeps during its active period dependent on the sensing data since the node does not contain the sensor hardware itself. This means that energy consumption is reduced by preventing unnecessary transmission in the active time. Also, the MDA achieves effective aggregating, because it processes aggregation at the same range of active duration as that of the same sensing data type. Therefore, the energy-efficiency of the whole sensor network increases.",

Data loss and corruption is inevitable in wireless sensor networks due to the wireless interference, limited sensor power and outlier from malicious electronic devices and so on. Therefore, before processing sensor data in different wireless sensor network applications, certain data cleaning steps need to be performed to ensure the data quality, such as dealing with outliers, missing sensor readings, and noisy data. In this paper, we discuss the issues need to be considered in the data cleaning steps of this integrated data cleaning model for signal processing in wireless sensor networks. We also present an integrated model for data cleaning on signal processing systems in wireless sensor network to deal with different data cleaning problems.",

      "Title": "By-Passing Infected Areas in Wireless Sensor Networks Using BPR",
      "Abstract": "Abnormalities in sensed data streams indicate the spread of malicious attacks, hardware failure and software corruption among the different nodes in a wireless sensor network. These factors of node infection can affect generated and incoming data streams resulting in high chances of inaccurate data, misleading packet translation, wrong decision making and severe communication disruption. This problem is detrimental to real-time applications having stringent quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. The sensed data from other uninfected regions might also get stuck in an infected region should no prior alternative arrangements are made. Although several existing methods (BOUNDHOLE and GAR) can be used to mitigate these issues, their performance is bounded by some limitations, mainly the high risk of falling into routing loops and involvement in unnecessary transmissions. This paper provides a solution to by-pass the infected nodes dynamically using a <italic>twin rolling balls technique</italic> and also divert the packets that are trapped inside the identified area. The identification of infected nodes is done by adapting a Fuzzy data clustering approach which classifies the nodes based on the fraction of anomalous data that is detected in individual data streams. This information is then used in the proposed by-passed routing (BPR) which rotates two balls in two directions simultaneously: clockwise and counter-clockwise. The first node that hits any ball in any direction and is uninfected, is selected as the next hop. We are also concerned with the incoming packets or the <italic> packets-on-the-fly</italic> that may be affected when this problem occurs. Besides solving both of the problems in the existing methods, the proposed BPR technique has greatly improved the studied QoS parameters as shown by almost 40 percent increase in the overall performance.",

      "Abstract": "As the rapid development of Internet of things, a large number of devices, instruments and sensors will connect and collaborate to achieve Smart Planet. One of the key challenges is to integrate devices into business process. SOA is an ideal infrastructure for business process management as applications are invoked using standard interfaces and protocols. It's convenient to use device-oriented web services (doWS) to encapsulate devices functions. A doWS may conflict with other doWS because devices can't be controlled by more than one client at the same time. This brings additional complexity to web service composition. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive device collaboration model to doWS choreography. This model includes device layer, doWS layer, compatible resource layer and process layer, where device layer represent devices, doWS layer encapsulates devices functions, compatible resource layer abstracts compatible device operations as resource and avoid of conflict, process layer describes the collaboration process. Analysis shows that, this model can integrate devices with Web Services, and can achieve the conflict detection of doWS. This model is effective in the Internet of things.",

Conventional BOT systems extract target-originated bearings in noisy measurements, locate and track targets based on the bearings in real time. We propose a tracking scheme by modifying BOT systems for UWSNs where a multidimensional assignment (MDA) method is used to extract target-originated bearings and to associate them with corresponding targets. In addition, a threshold-based decision in extracting bearings in MDA and a local Kalman filter is proposed to keep tracking information at a floating beacon even if a target is undetected. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme has advantage of tracking accuracy over recently known work under low detection probability.",

      "Abstract": "With recent advances in smart phones and wearable sensors, Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have been proposed for use in continuous, remote electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. In such systems, sampling the ECG at clinically recommended rates (250 Hz) and wireless transmission of the collected data incurs high energy consumption at the energy-constrained body sensor. The large volume of collected data also makes data storage at the sensor infeasible. Thus, there is a need for reducing the energy consumption and data size at the sensor, while maintaining the ECG quality required for diagnosis. In this paper, we propose GeM-REM, a resource-efficient ECG monitoring method for BSNs. GeM-REM uses a generative ECG model at the base station and its lightweight version at the sensor. The sensor transmits data only when the sensed ECG deviates from model-based values, thus saving transmission energy. Further, the model parameters are continually updated based on the sensed ECG. The proposed approach enables storage of ECG data in terms of model parameters rather than data samples, which reduces the required storage space. Implementation on a sensor platform and evaluation using real ECG data from MIT-BIH dataset shows transmission energy and data storage reduction ratios of 42.1:1 and 37.3:1 respectively, which are better than state of the art ECG data compression schemes.",

      "Title": "Model-Driven Traffic Data Acquisition in Vehicular Sensor Networks",
      "Abstract": "In recent years, the global position system (GPS) is widely used in technical products, such as navigation devices, GPS loggers, PDAs and mobile phones. Hence, traffic data collection platforms are proposed to collect GPS data points for traffic monitoring. In traffic data collection platforms, each vehicle equips with GPS modules and the wireless communication interfaces, such as 3G or WiFi networks, and the GPS data sensed (e.g., the speed and the position) are sent to the server. One challenge issue is that if a significant number of vehicles upload their GPS data points at the same time, it is possible that the wireless network cannot offer enough network resources for simultaneous network connections. This paper proposes a framework MDC (standing for Model-based Data Collection) to reduce the amount of data transmission and the number of vehicles reporting their GPS data points. The MDC framework is executed at the server and vehicle side collaboratively. In the vehicle side, given a series of GPS data points, model functions are derived to represent the raw GPS data points. Hence, each vehicle could report some coefficients that describe its movements instead of reporting all position information. Since vehicles move along with road segments that are usually a set of line segments, algorithm LR (standing for Liner Regression) is proposed to determine a set of line functions to represent movements of vehicles. By observing the spatial-temporal locality in traffic data, algorithm KR (standing for Kernel Regression) is developed to derive a set of kernel functions to model a series of speed readings sensed. Moreover, with the spatial-temporal locality feature in traffic data, an in-network aggregation mechanism are proposed to determine a set of groups and for each group, only one vehicle needs to report traffic data, thereby further reducing the number of simultaneous connections. Experimental results show that MDC can collect traffic data effectively and the ef- - ficiently.",

      "Abstract": "Business method patents represent a new challenge for technology management in the logistics industry. (i) They open up possibilities of patenting to companies which have never before utilized this kind of property right. Hence, the technology management is challenged to implement a patent strategy that stands up to patent-driven changes in the competitive environment. (ii) Patents of this kind usually rely on inventions driven by business-processes rather than technical aspects. And this poses a challenge to the technology management of companies in which patenting is a commonly used instrument for defending primarily technical solutions. To provide some case-related insight into how technology management in the logistics industry deals with the abovementioned challenges, we intend to analyze the utilization of such patents in the context of intelligent sensor networks. We are going to develop several hypotheses and propose a workflow based approach for patent analysis, comprising (i) the systematic analysis of a business process, and (ii) the use of functions of this business process for the identification of relevant patent documents. One major finding is that only relatively few logistic companies are active in this patent field. Accordingly and this can be regarded as an alarming signal, which might apply to other industries as well technology management in the analyzed field is missing a major opportunity to gain advantages and to secure the freedom to operate.",

      "Title": "Model-driven parametric monitoring of high-dimensional nonlinear functional profiles",
      "Abstract": "In order to cope with system complexity and dynamic environments, modern industries are investing in a variety of sensor networks and data acquisition systems to increase information visibility. Multi-sensor systems bring the proliferation of high-dimensional functional profiles that capture rich information on the evolving dynamics of natural and engineered processes. This provides an unprecedented opportunity for online monitoring of operational quality and integrity of complex systems. However, the classical methodology of statistical process control is not concerned about high-dimensional sensor signals and is limited in the capability to perform multi-sensor fault diagnostics. It is not uncommon that multi-dimensional sensing capabilities are not fully utilized for decision making. This paper presents a new model-driven parametric monitoring strategy for the detection of dynamic fault patterns in high-dimensional functional profiles that are nonlinear and nonstationary. First, we developed a sparse basis function model of high-dimensional functional profiles, thereby reducing the large amount of data to a parsimonious set of model parameters (i.e., weight, shifting and scaling factors) while preserving the information. Further, we utilized the lasso-penalized logistic regression model to select a low-dimensional set of sensitive predictors for fault diagnostics. Experimental results on real-world data from patient monitoring showed that the proposed methodology outperforms traditional methods and effectively identify a sparse set of sensitive features from high-dimensional datasets for process monitoring and fault diagnostics.",

We present analysis showing that, as a first order approximation, breathing induces sinusoidal variation in the measured RSS on a link, with amplitude a function of the relative amplitude and phase of the breathing-affected multipath. We show that although an individual link may not reliably detect breathing, the collective spectral content of a network of devices reliably indicates the presence and rate of breathing. We present a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of breathing rate, amplitude, and phase, which uses the RSS data from many links simultaneously. We show experimental results which demonstrate that reliable detection and frequency estimation is possible with 30 seconds of data, within 0.07 to 0.42 breaths per minute (bpm) RMS error in several experiments. The experiments also indicate that the use of directional antennas may improve the systems robustness to external motion.",

      "Abstract": "The Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) is a wireless network used for communication among sensor nodes operating on or inside the human body in order to monitor vital body parameters and movements. The design and the development of such systems for health monitoring have gained a lot of attention recently in both the research and the industry. Mainly motivated by the increasing of healthcare costs and propelled by the recent advances in the development of miniature health monitoring devices. This paper presents a preventive health care system with a flexible design. By using sensors nodes in combination with a mobile data collector, both daily continuous monitoring as well as specific controls are provided. In this work, we propose a system based on an architecture with heterogeneous nodes to provide continuous monitoring. A model has been defined to describe the system global behavior. An important aspect of this work is that we propose a model driven (MDE) approach to derive the behavior of each node in the network from the system global behavior. The derived behaviors include the synchronization messages to ensure the global coordination among the system components.",

      "Abstract": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) had been proved to be a powerful tool to investigate the white matter integrity and visualize the neuronal axons in vivo. Most of the DTI-based studies mainly used the region-of-interest approach to investigate the abnormalities in areas of white matter tracts involved in mood regulation for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). In this study, we explored the structure of the fiber connections in whole-brain white matter for both major depressive patients and healthy subjects based on the DTI tractography. With the automatic anatomical labeling (AAL) process, each individual brain can be partitioned into ninety regions in normalized space so that the number of the connected fibers and histograms of the fiber lengths between any paired regions can be estimated. Twenty-three MDD patients and twenty-four age and gender-matched normal subjects were recruited. Our results concluded that: 1) the numbers of connected fibers revealed significant increase (pvalue <; 0.005) in the MDD group compared with the normal group in mood-regulation related region pairs consisting of right superior frontal gyrus to right pallidum, right putamen to right precuneus, left pallidum to left precuneus, left superior parietal gyrus to right superior occipital gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus to right middle temporal gyrus, and both side lingual gyrus to both side superior temporal gyrus. Only two region pairs manifested significant decrease (p-value <; 0.005) in patient group, which were right insula to right superior temporal gyrus, and right precuneus to right inferior temporal gyrus; 2) the distributions of the connected fiber lengths for the detected region pairs with the increasing or decreasing fibers in MDD group were between 10 to 30 mm.",

Based on the investigation of the existing service discovery protocols, this article proposes a new service discovery methodology for next-generation mobile systems: model-based service discovery or MBSD. By taking advantage of the object management group (OMG) model-driven architecture (MDA) technique, model-based service discovery (MBSD) can generate service description automatically and more precisely. Furthermore, if developed via MDA, the discovered services can be regenerated into their model format and as such facilitate the service re-engineering in a finer manner. The system architecture of MBSD and its operation are presented and implemented. The proposed methodology is validated via a mobile service scenario",

      "Abstract": "Recently, IEEE 802.15.4a has specified a UWB PHY for low-rate commutation with ranging capability for wireless personnel area and sensor network applications. Related work is reported on low-rate energy-efficient UWB radios. A combination of the burst position modulation (BPM) and binary phase shift keying (BPSK) is adopted. With different coding rate, bursts per symbol, and chips per burst, the mean pulse repetition rate (PRF) could vary from 3.9 to 62.4MHz for data throughput of 120kHz to 31.2MHz. This work presents an UWB RF transceiver which supports 12 channels, variable date rate, and ranging capability as specified in IEEE802.15.4a. Transceiver IC is implemented in 0.18Î¼m CMOS technology.",

      "Abstract": "Unobtrusive continuous monitoring of important vital signs and activity metrics has the potential to provide remote health monitoring, at-home screening, and rapid notification of critical events such as heart attacks, falls, or respiratory distress. This paper contains validation results of a wireless Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) patch sensor consisting of two electrocardiography (ECG) electrodes, a microcontroller, a tri-axial accelerometer, and a BLE transceiver. The sensor measures heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), respiratory rate, posture, steps, and falls and was evaluated on a total of 25 adult participants who performed breathing exercises, activities of daily living (ADLs), various stretches, stationary cycling, walking/running, and simulated falls. Compared to reference devices, the heart rate measurement had a mean absolute error (MAE) of less than 2 bpm, time-domain HRV measurements had an RMS error of less than 15 ms, respiratory rate had an MAE of 1.1 breaths per minute during metronome breathing, posture detection had an accuracy of over 95% in two of the three patch locations, steps were counted with an absolute error of less than 5%, and falls were detected with a sensitivity of 95.2% and specificity of 100%.",

      "Abstract": "There has been a recent shift toward improving wireless access security within the OSI PHY layer by exploiting RF features that are inherently device specific and difficult to replicate by an unintended party. This work addresses the extraction and exploitation of RF \"fingerprints\" to classify emissions and provide device-specific identification. Burst transient detection precedes RF fingerprint extraction and is generally the most critical step in the overall process. This work provides a much needed sensitivity analysis of burst detection capability. The analysis is conducted using instantaneous amplitude responses with both Fractal-Bayesian Step Change Detection (Fractal-BSCD) and Variance Trajectory (VT) processes. The performance of each method is evaluated under varying SNR conditions using experimentally collected 802.11a OFDM signals. The impact of transient detection error on signal classification performance is then demonstrated using RF fingerprints and Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA) with Maximum Likelihood (ML) classification. The VT technique emerges as the better alternative for all SNRs considered and yields MDA-ML classification accuracy that is consistent with \"perfect\" transient estimation performance.",

      "Abstract": "Spectrum access scheme is a fundamental component in building efficient wireless networks. Conventional methods such as proactive channel assignment is costly due to large amount of protocol overhead. Also, those algorithms suffer from its inability in dealing with channel dynamics. The opportunistic methods however, spend more time on probing, and suffer from the myopic decisions as well. We present a decision based dynamic spectrum access algorithm (DDSA), which is built upon the Markov decision process (MDP), and could adaptively handle the DSA process for higher throughput. We employ quiet probing and dynamic controlling mechanisms in DDSA, so as to achieve a reduced protocol overhead and improved adaptivity. Different from previous methods, the DDSA is a model driven method, and we use the modeling technique on the IEEE 802.11 DCF for virtual channel state probing. The modeling technique could help us improve the accuracy on channel state, and reduce protocol overhead. Using a heuristic and adaptive algorithm named `hindsight optimization', we solve the hardness in computing the MDP. Moreover, under the feasibility testing and scaling processes, the validated decision can be confidentially applied for a congestion-free DSA.",

      "Title": "Mobilizing ICT, business and human processes: An integrative conceptual model",
      "Abstract": "Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are changing exponentially and will continue to do so in the near future. Mobility is everyday human activity. Every human interaction is based around mobility. Now the mobility in computing is entering its next stage by making computing mobile by transferring computing to mobile devices. There is already a trend in this direction by employing various organizational based applications for CRM, Logistics, Sales, Marketing, etc. Driven by economical and technological reasons these small organizational changes will converge into full organizational implementations. These organizational changes will spill over in everyday human life, e.g. C2C applications. Despite these big changes there is not a â€œstructural view to mobility potential discovery at organizational level or every day human activity levelâ€. This not only makes every day human activity and business processes less efficient but also slows down the technological adaptation that organizations need to do to keep with basic infrastructural changes in the technology. Therefore, this research has been undertaken. Through an in-depth literature review and industry experience, this research devices an integrative conceptual model in this direction. Where the basic characteristics of mobility and technology can be brought out together in such a way that hidden and unseen mobility potentials in organizations and everyday human activities can be recognized, thereby changing the view to future business development or recognizing new vertical business segments. The model developed in this research may have diverse important applications in research and practice. Several important directions for future research are also suggested by this research.",

      "Title": "A novel framework for jamming detection and classification in wireless networks",
      "Abstract": "Launching jamming attacks is trivial but detecting and classifying attacks are more difficult especially in Wireless Networks. This is due to the open nature of this medium that leaves it vulnerable to multiple security threats. Anyone with a transceiver can launch jamming based DoS attacks on wireless transmissions, inject spurious messages, or jam legitimate ones. Jamming attacks usually occur at physical and MAC layers and involves different methods, techniques and technology. Therefore designing an efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a challenging task. The objective of this paper is to propose a new IDS framework that enables detection and classification of jamming in physical and MAC layers in wireless networks. To address this, problems that arise due to jamming at both layers are identified and investigated. Lists of parameters and variables are associated with jamming are identified and formulated to detect and classify attacks. Finally a novel IDS framework for detecting and classifying jamming attacks is proposed. This framework is found to be able to detect and classify jamming faster and more efficient.",

While horizontal coupling of processes has been achieved through Business Process Management and Integrated Manufacturing Systems, vertical management and operation across organization layers still lack unifying approaches. In particular the vertical integration of business processes with production planning systems and production control systems is of crucial importance for agile business development. Moreover, process designs on the management and operational level increasingly need to be accomplished by the stakeholders themselves. Tackling these critical issues requires a human-centered and universal approach, as provided by subject-oriented modeling and execution. We demonstrate the horizontal and vertical integration of processes revealing fundamental capabilities and development potential of communication-based designs.",

      "Abstract": "Doppler-based non-contact vital signs (NCVS) sensor systems can monitor the heart and respiration rates without touching the patient, but the accuracy of the NCVS sensing can be degraded considerably by background clutters and movements artifacts from the monitored subject or other motions in the measurement environment. We have, therefore, developed a high directivity phased-array antenna NCVS system that can significantly increase the sensing accuracy and the monitoring range in a typical office cubicle setting. Depending on the position of the beam spot illuminated on the chest, our custom-made beam-steerable phased array NCVS system at 2.4GHz has demonstrated the accuracy of the heart rate monitoring to be within +/- 2 bpm (beat-per-minute) for 92.5%-99.2% of the time at 0.75m. As the monitoring range is extended to 1-1.5m with beam directly illuminating on the center of the chest, the heart rate monitoring accuracy remains within +/- 5 bpm above 78% of time. With more improvement, this phased array NCVS system should benefit patients considerably for telemedicine and remote monitoring, as the patient's vital signs can be monitored comfortably and continuously in both home and office settings, eventually capable of detecting potential sleep apnea and other respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms in real-time.",

It is allowing people to make the best use of business opportunities. However, most of the current m-business models are simply an extension of traditional e-business models to support wireless networks. Being not designed for mobile applications essentially, these models lack of mobility support in nature, and their security measures are no longer suitable in wireless environment. The session initiation protocol (SIP) is an application-level control protocol for multimedia conferencing over IP network. SIP provides excellent mobility support and fine security mechanisms. After detailed research of SIPpsilas applicability in constructing m-business systems, an m-business model based on SIP is proposed in this paper. An implementation example based on the new model is presented. Tests show that the new model has an innate advantage in mobile communications with fine security support.",

A heartbeat sensor is directly connected to a microcontroller, which measures the Beat per Minute (BPM). This heart beat sensor is designed to give digital output of heart beat when a finger is placed inside it. With each heart pulse the detector signal vanes. This variation is converted to electrical pulse. This signal is amplified and triggered through an amplifier which outputs +5V logic level signal. The digital pulses are fed to the external interrupt of microcontroller 8051. By using a software counter in the code, we can count the pulses. The microcontroller (8051) is here used to develop a heart beat monitoring system. By placing your finger in between a LED and photo resistance, we can detect the pulses of heart.

      "Abstract": "Ontology is a formal explicit specification of a shared conceptualization. With the development of internet technology, how to reuse the distributed ontologies with varies semantic relevance published in the network becomes more and more important. According to the analysis of the Super-Peer Model (SPM), SWRL-Bridge-Peer Model (SWRL-BPM), an improved Super-Peer Model based on the extended SWRL is reported in this paper. In the SWRL-BPM, the query performances about flexibility and efficiency of SPM have been expended, meanwhile SWRL-BPM can solve the problems of large load handling better than SPM. The important thing is that SWRL-BPM shows the good property to reuse, expand and combine the distributed ontology by some means. The knowledge in different domains can be integrated as a larger pool of information to support new communication and use for enterprise on the Internet of Things. The experiments results indicate that SWRL-BPM shows a significant performance improvement on retrieving the dynamic information in an ontology ecosystem.",

M2M - as a part of the Internet of Things (IoT) - is, at the present, one of the main drivers behind the growth in mobile subscribers, with all of the world's largest electronic communications operators now having several million M2M subscribers in their mobile networks. The M2M communication model is linked to the interaction between IoT endpoints, which represent - from the point of view of business process and end user applications - service end points that can be easily embedded in emerging service oriented enterprise systems and service delivery platforms. To capitalize on the projected expansion of the M2M market, both regulators and telecommunications operators (as well as service providers) will have to be agile and flexible. The challenge of embedding real world information into networks, services and applications through the convergence of domains like Technologies, Electronic Communications and Intelligence - enabled by context aware technologies, nanoelectronics, sensors and cloud computing - will bring about the development of novel services, innovative products, new interfaces and new applications.",

      "Abstract": "Timed automata, priced timed automata and energy automata have emerged as useful formalisms for modeling a real-time and energy-aware systems as found in several embedded and cyber-physical systems. Whereas the real-time model checker UPPAAL allows for efficient verification of hard timing constraints of timed automata, model checking of priced timed automata and energy automata are in general undecidable â€” notable exception being cost-optimal reachability for priced timed automata as supported by the branch UPPAAL Cora. These obstacles are overcome by UPPAAL-SMC, the new highly scalable engine of UPPAAL, which supports (distributed) statistical model checking of stochastic hybrid systems with respect to weighted metric temporal logic. The talk will review UPPAAL-SMC and its applications to the domains of energy-harvesting wireless sensor networks, schedulability and execution time analysis for mixed criticality systems, battery-aware scheduling with respect to correctness, fault- and performance analysis. In the talk I will also indicate how UPPAAL SMC may play be of benefit for counter example generation, refinement checking, testing, controller synthesis and optimization.",

On the purpose to solve this problem, we present a reliable frame called Minson which is a dynamic adaption system based on multi-agent and context-awareness. Firstly, in order to describe the problem, we define the person, task, organization, resource meta-model. Secondly, we introduce the scene state map which guide our system which state to choose when ecosystem context changes. Next, we also provide the event meta model which is a state space describing the interruption of our context in Smart Office. Finally, strategy rules about reasoning are proposed. An algorithm is given for self-adapting in the ecosystem considering the organization and task balance. The result shows the proposed framework is a feasible method to cope with Multi-Agent and Context-aware in business process adapting.",

      "Abstract": "In many sensor networks applications, sensors collect correlated measurements of a physical field, e.g., temperature field in a building or in a data center. However, the locations of the sensors are usually inconsistent with the application requirements. In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the field at arbitrary positions of interest, where there are possibly no sensors, from the irregularly placed sensors. We map this sensor network on a graph, and, by introducing the concepts of interconnection matrices, system digraphs, and cut point sets, we can pose sensor network tradeoffs and derive real-time field estimation algorithms. The results of temperature field estimation, obtained from simulations and real world experiments, show that the methodology presented in this paper can successfully predict the field values at arbitrary locations, including others than the ones with sensors.",

For this purpose, we propose an extension to the openHAB home automation framework based on model driven technologies. The user study presented in this paper shows an improvement of the average task completion time compared to the control group, and gives valuable subjective feedback on designing consistent documentation for complex IoT systems.",

      "Abstract": "Radio-frequency identification (RFID) has a great number of unfulfilled prospects. Part of the problem until now has been the value proposition behind the technology-it has been marketed as a replacement technique for the barcode when the reality is that it has far greater capability than simply non-line-of-sight identification, towards decision making in strategic management and reengineered business processes. The vision of the internet of things (IOT) has not eventuated but a world in which every object you can see around you carries the possibility of being connected to the internet is still within the realm of possibility. However incremental innovations may see RFID being sold as a service (much like photocopiers are maintained today) than a suite of technologies within a system that are sold as individual or bundled packaged components. This paper outlines the vision for such a product service system, what kinds of smart applications we are likely to see in the future as a result, and the importance of data management capabilities in planetary-scale systems.",

      "Abstract": "With the arrival of cloud computing and the internet of things, the difficulty of extracting data from the cloud services is preventing some organizations from adopting cloud computing. At the same time, the number of web services increases dramatically, and the granularity of service is different, so how to choose a suitable granularity service also becomes a problem that needs to be resolved. So a storage strategy for cloud computing services is given and the method based on event stream is used to construct the hierarchal model of services which can provide different functional services or different granularity services to meet the business requirements. Firstly, the storage strategy for cloud computing services is that, when registering the services, the meta-data of services will be extracted and stored into database according to certain structure. Secondly, the Event Cloud can be constructed as the one-way event processing, which provide the raw data for more-way event processing. Then the more-way event processing can construct the hierarchical model of services with certain composition goal. The prototype system has been developed in order to fulfill the application, both human events and RFID events can trigger other events in the cloud events, which can create new business models, improve business processes, and reduce costs and risks.",

During the test, participants were asked to undergo a series of defined breathing protocols which included normal breathing, paced breathing between 8-23 breaths per minute (bpm) and a recovery period following moderate exercise. Statistical analysis of the data collected shows a mean difference of -0.73, a standard deviation of 1.61, limits of agreement of -3.88 and +2.42 bpm and a P-value of 0.22. This testing demonstrates comparable performance of the Aingeal device in measuring respiration rate with a well-accepted and widely used alternative method.",

      "Title": "Multidimensional assignment by dual decomposition",
      "Abstract": "Data association, or finding the correspondence between targets and measurements, is an integral part of a surveillance system. This paper studies a classical approach to the multiple scan data association problem, namely multidimensional assignment (MDA). Obtaining the optimal solution to the MDA problem is NP-hard for N â‰¥ 3, i.e., the computation time exponentially grows with the number of scans. The most successful approach for solving these problems has been using Lagrangian relaxation. This paper investigates the use of the dual decomposition approach, an alternative formulation for Lagrangian relaxation, in MDA problems. For a challenging scenario where targets are closely spaced, the dual decomposition formulation converges to the optimal solution in fewer iterations than a prior recursive Lagrangian relaxation algorithm. The Lagrangian relaxation algorithms are also compared to a formulation that uses loopy belief propagation (LBP). While LBP is not guaranteed to converge, and if it converges it is not guaranteed to be optimal, empirical results show that if LBP converges it produces similar solutions in fewer iterations than the optimisation algorithms.",

      "Title": "RESTful Web Service Mining: Simple Algorithm Supporting Resource-Oriented Systems",
      "Abstract": "Composition of Web Services (WS) into business processes (BP) often results in occurrence of defects in a process: implicit dependencies, incorrect contexts, non-optimal or bottlenecked workflow, and deadlocks. To deal with these problems, WS Mining (process mining in SOA) research provides methods and tools to discover, evaluate and enhance real world processes basing on a process model discovered from a log. Unfortunately, current research in this field only concerns SOAP-WS which are not as well-suited as RESTful-WS in the context of current research trends like Internet of Things or Web 2.0. WS Mining methods and tools should consider RESTful-WS where functionality of the system is expressed in the form of resources and relationships among them. In this paper we show the idea of discovering process models for interacting RESTful-WS with respect to both workflow and resources perspectives. We introduce extended version of the Î± algorithm (AA), RESTful-WS mining algorithm (RMA), which discovers hierarchical process models and resource-oriented perspective of a process including local and global behavior. Finally, we present a brief discussion on how RMA decomposes a problem into smaller ones, significantly reducing the execution time in real time scenarios.",

      "Title": "On the relative importance of vocal source, system, and prosody in human depression",
      "Abstract": "In Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), neurophysiologic changes can alter motor control [1][2] and therefore alter speech production by influencing vocal fold motion (source), the vocal tract (system), and melody (prosody). In this paper, we use a database of voice recordings from 28 depressed subjects treated over a 6-week period [3] to compare correlations between features from each of the three speech-production components and clinical assessments of MDD. Toward biomarkers for audio-based continuous monitoring of depression severity, we explore the contextual dependence of these correlations with free-response and read speech, and show tradeoffs across categories of features in these two example contexts. Likewise, we also investigate the context-and speech component-dependence of correlations between our vocal features and assessment of individual symptoms of MDD (e.g., depressed mood, agitation, energy). Finally, motivated by our initial findings, we describe how context may be useful in â€œon-bodyâ€ monitoring of MDD to facilitate identification of depression and evaluation of its treatment.",

      "Abstract": "Privacy of physiological data collected by a network of embedded sensors on human body is an important issue to be considered. Physiological signal-based security is a light weight solution which eliminates the need for security key storage and complex exponentiation computation in sensors. An important concern is whether such security measures are vulnerable to attacks, where the attacker is in close proximity to a Body Sensor Network (BSN) and senses physiological signals through non-contact processes such as electromagnetic coupling. Recent studies show that when two individuals are in close proximity, the electrocardiogram (ECG) of one person gets coupled to the electroencephalogram (EEG) of the other, thus indicating a possibility of proximity-based security attacks. This paper proposes a model-driven approach to proximity-based attacks on security using physiological signals and evaluates its feasibility. Results show that a proximity-based attack can be successful even without the exact reconstruction of the physiological data sensed by the attacked BSN. Our results show that with a 30 second handshake we can break PSKA with an average probability of 0.3 (0.24 minimum and 0.5 maximum).",

In this paper, we propose a novel attraction/repulsion model driven by the population density and focus on the special collective process of our model. In our work, an agent can adjusts its asymmetric A/R(attraction/repulsion) function during the collective process under the influence of local population density. Such roles of asymmetric interactions different from the symmetric ones in traditional models have been analyzed by complex network theory with extensive illustrations, and different motifs of collective formation patterns have been visualized.",

Model Driven Architecture (MDA) is used to develop Software as a Service (SaaS) so as to facilitate mobile applications development by relieving developers from technical details. However, traditional service composition or mashup are somewhat unavailable due to complex relations and heterogeneous deployed environments. For the purpose of building cloud-enabled mobile applications in a configurable and adaptive way, Model-Driven Development Patterns based on semantic reasoning mechanism are provided towards CoT application development. Firstly, a meta-model covering both multi-view business elements and service components are provided for models transformation. Then, based on formal representation of models, three patterns from different tiers of Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework are used to transform business models into service component system so as to configure cloud services rapidly. Lastly, a related software platform is also provided for verification. The result shows that the platform is applicable for rapid system development by means of various service integration patterns.",

      "Abstract": "Internet of Things applications analyze our past habits through sensor measures to anticipate future trends. To yield accurate predictions, intelligent systems not only rely on single numerical values, but also on structured models aggregated from different sensors. Computation theory, based on the discretization of observable data into timed events, can easily lead to millions of values. Time series and similar database structures can efficiently index the mere data, but quickly reach computation and storage limits when it comes to structuring and processing IoT data. We propose a concept of continuous models that can handle high-volatile IoT data by defining a new type of meta attribute, which represents the continuous nature of IoT data. On top of traditional discrete object-oriented modeling APIs, we enable models to represent very large sequences of sensor values by using mathematical polynomials. We show on various IoT datasets that this significantly improves storage and reasoning efficiency.",

      "Title": "CARM: Crowd-sensing Accurate Outdoor RSS Maps with Error-prone Smartphone Measurements",
      "Abstract": "RSS (Received Signal Strength) maps provide fundamental information for mobile users, aiding the development of conflict graph and improving communication quality to cope with the complex and unstable wireless channels. In this paper, we present CARM: a scheme that exploits crowd-sensing to construct outdoor RSS maps using smartphone measurements. An alternative yet impractical approach in literature is to appeal to professionals with customized devices. Our work distinguishes itself from previous studies by supporting off-the-shelf smartphone devices, and more importantly, by mitigating the error-prone nature and inaccuracies of these devices to build RSS maps through crowd-sensing. The main challenges are that, we need to calibrate error-prone smartphone measurements with â€˜inaccurateâ€™ and â€˜incompleteâ€™ data. To address these challenges, we build the measurement error model of smartphone based on the experimental observations and analyses. Moreover, we propose an iterative method based on DFP(Davidon- Fletcher-Powell) algorithm, to estimate the parameters for the error models of each smartphone and the signal propagation models of each AP simultaneously. The key intuition is that, the calibrated measurements based on the error model are constrained by the physics of the signal propagation model. Finally, a model-driven RSS map construction scheme is built upon these two models with these estimated parameters. The theoretical analyses prove the optimality and convergence of this iterative method. Also, the crowdsensing experiments show that, CARM can achieve an accurate RSS map, decreasing the average error from 19.8 dBm to 8.5 dBm.",

      "Abstract": "Networked systems have adapted Radio Frequency identification technology (RFID) to automate their business process. The Networked RFID Systems (NRS) has some unique characteristics which raise new privacy and security concerns for organizations and their NRS systems. The businesses are always having new realization of business needs using NRS. One of the most recent business realization of NRS implementation on large scale distributed systems (such as Internet of Things (IoT), supply chain) is to ensure visibility and traceability of the object throughout the chain. However, this requires assurance of security and privacy to ensure lawful business operation. In this paper, we are proposing a secure tracker protocol that will ensure not only visibility and traceability of the object but also genuineness of the object and its travel path on-site. The proposed protocol is using Physically Unclonable Function (PUF), Diffie-Hellman algorithm and simple cryptographic primitives to protect privacy of the partners, injection of fake objects, non-repudiation, and unclonability. The tag only performs a simple mathematical computation (such as combination, PUF and division) that makes the proposed protocol suitable to passive tags. To verify our security claims, we performed experiment on Security Protocol Description Language (SPDL) model of the proposed protocol using automated claim verification tool Scyther. Our experiment not only verified our claims but also helped us to eliminate possible attacks identified by Scyther.",

This is taking place through the convergence of the global industrial system with the power of advanced computing, analytics, low-cost sensing, and new levels of connectivity enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT). These innovations will bring higher efficiency, flexibility, and interoperability among industries, although they belong to different production ecosystems. This paper describes an IoT platform and the related prototypes developed within the project: Enabling Business-Based Internet of Things and Services (ebbits), with a focus on the industrial domain. Heterogeneous applications were deployed and tested, including a wireless sensor and actuator network for industrial machines monitoring and a radio-frequency-identification-based system for operator management, locating, and authorization, which also includes an interactive user interface for portable devices to visualize real-time information from physical-world devices. Moreover, tools for model-driven development are used to simplify the process of building IoT applications. Those developments are based on IoT middleware that is developed and deployed by the project to enable the seamless integration of heterogeneous technologies and processes into mainstream enterprise systems.

The smart phone application required to implement this framework has been designed and is described here. This technology could greatly improve telemonitoring of patients with chronic heart failure. A simulated portable EIT device was constructed that wirelessly sends data to the smart phone. The developed application receives wireless data transmission, performs EIT image reconstruction, and extracts a post-processing measure correlated to cardiac output. Data transmission rates of 4.2 MB/s were achieved between a simulated EIT system (server) and phone (client). Image reconstruction and post-processing implemented on a smart phone requires 332 ms, moderately longer than the 109 ms required on a modern laptop based implementation. The 332 ms is well within the approximately one second processing time needed to measure beat-to-beat cardiac output (i.e. assuming a 60 bpm heart rate).",

      "Title": "Online model-driven data acquisition for wireless sensor networks",
      "Abstract": "Model-driven data acquisition is one of the strategies utilized to save sensor node energy in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), which suppresses data transmission by running one synchronized prediction model at both the sensor and sink node, and only when the predicted value deviates far from the real value should the sensor node transmit the sensed data to the sink node. In this paper, we propose a novel online model-driven data acquisition method which runs two prediction models on the sensor node simultaneously. Specifically, one model is updated online using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) learning algorithm once a new sensor data is available and the other is used to predict sensor value and updated with the former one when it is time for model re-training. The collaborative working of these two models, together with the SGD learning algorithm, solve two main problems of existing methods: data transmission during off-line model re-training and high resource requirement for model update. Extensive experiments are performed to verify the benefits of our method over two existing methods based on more than 20000 data records from three data sets. The experiment results demonstrate that up to 96% of data transmission are reduced by our method while remaining user defined data accuracy, which outperforms the compared methods in terms of energy usage and data accuracy.",

      "Title": "Toward an Anonymous Process Mining",
      "Abstract": "Process mining is a modern family of techniques applied to datasets generated from business processes run in organizations, in order to improve and obtain useful insights and performance measurements on the processes themselves (with clear societal and economical benefits). While these techniques are very promising in understanding business processes, their complete and efficient implementation inside the organizations is often not possible. Hence, in a way similar to what is done for most non core activities, and in particular for most ICT services, companies evaluate the possibility of outsourcing such task. However, the confidentiality of the dataset related to the business processes are often key assets for most of modern companies. Then, in order to avoid threats that might come from disclosing such information, most companies decide not to benefit from these process mining techniques. In this work, we propose a possible approach toward a complete solution which allows outsourcing of Process Mining without thwarting the confidentiality of the dataset and processes. Furthermore, we provide a prototype implementation of our proposed approach and run several experiments that confirmed the feasibility of our approach.

      "Abstract": "The design of a 13.56 MHz/402 MHz autonomous wireless sensor node with asynchronous ECG monitoring for near field communication is presented. The sensor node consists of an RF energy harvester (RFEH), a power management unit, an ECG readout, a data encoder and an RF backscattering transmitter. The energy harvester supplies the system with 1.25 V and offers a power conversion efficiency of 19% from a <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <img src=\"/images/tex/35810.gif\" alt=\"{-}13\"> </formula> dBm RF source at 13.56 MHz.

      "Abstract": "This work presents a system for unobtrusive cardiac feedback in daily life. It addresses the whole pipeline from data acquisition over data processing to data visualization including wearable integration. ECG signals are recorded with a novel ECG sensor supporting Bluetooth Low Energy, which is able to transmit raw ECG data as well as estimated heart rate. ECG signals are processed in real-time on a mobile device to automatically classify the user's heart beats. A novel application for Android-based mobile devices was developed for data visualization. It offers several modes for cardiac feedback, from measuring the current heart rate to continuously monitoring the user's heart status. It also allows to store acquired data in an internal database as well as in the Google Fit platform. Further, the application provides extensions for wearables like Google Glass and smartwatches running on Android Wear. Hardware performance evaluation was performed by comparing the course of heart rate between the novel ECG sensor and a commercial ECG sensor. The mean absolute error between the two sensors was 4.83 bpm with a standard deviation of 4.46 bpm, and a Pearson correlation of 0.922. A qualitative evaluation was performed for the Android application with special emphasis on the daily usability and the wearable integration. When the Google Glass was integrated, the subjects rated the application as 2.8/5 (0 = Bad, 5 = Excellent), whereas when the application was integrated with a smartwatch the rating increased to 4.2/5.",

      "Title": "Detection, Mitigation and Quantitative Security Risk Assessment of Invisible Attacks at Enterprise Network",
      "Abstract": "Given the increasing dependence of our societies on network information systems and the efforts being provided by security communities to secure their networks, a strong sense of insecurity still prevails. Therefore, there is a need for new countermeasures against these cyber-attacks which causes disruption to business processes. The evaluation approaches to detect and assess the security risk level of cyber-attacks are harder to develop due to lack of information such as scope of attack and the way it originate. This paper assess the security risk level of those attacks which are targeting to IT, business networks and critical infrastructure, and where malicious user's actions are direct threats to the targeted system but yet not visible by the targeted system. This is achieved after classifying each Google dorks (commands) as an invisible attacks according to their characteristics. In addition, a method is devised to secure any organization's network against invisible attacks by creating a rule in Snort NIDPS signature database. Furthermore, OWASP risk rating methodology is incorporated to assess the overall severity risk level of invisible attacks on the network in terms of high, medium and low. Since, this method does not provide the quantitative security risk value of enterprise network, therefore, quantitative security risk assessment of enterprise network is determined using severity risk assessment table.",

The user interface is developed as an Android application. Because of the technological progress and the increasing use of full portable systems, such as tablets and cell phones, it is important to understand the functioning and development of an application, which provides a basis for conducting studies using this technology as an interface. The project development includes concepts of electronics and its application to achieve a portable and functional final project, besides using a specific programmable integrated circuit for electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram and electromyogram, the ADS1294. Using a simulator of cardiac signals, 36 different waveforms were recorded, including normal sinus rhythm, arrhythmias and artifacts. Simulations include variations of heart rate from 30 to 190 beats per minute (BPM), with variations in peak amplitude of 1 mV to 2 mV. Tests were performed with a subject at rest and in motion, observing the signals obtained and the damage to their interpretation due to the introduction of muscle movement artifacts in motion situations.",

      "Abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) represents an inherently more complex domain for the design and implementation of middleware than traditional Enterprise systems. Existing examples of middleware within WSN are limited in their scope and are primarily affiliated with influencing the behaviour of nodes only, with some middleware being capable of operating at node and gateway level. We propose an Open Framework Middleware (OFM) that addresses these limitations. It is loosely based on the principles of Model Driven Engineering (MDE) and also incorporates some of the concepts of cloud computing's ubiquity and pervasiveness. It views the network as a single entity, that is a middleware operating at all levels of the network i.e. node, gateway and control level. It provides distribution, scalability, flexibility and adaptability at deployment, operation and integration levels.",

At the same time, these applications are also mission-critical with serious quality of service requirements such as real-time performance, continuous availability, high security and privacy. Pu argues that the traditional process-oriented programming languages and software architectures should be augmented by distributed event-based facilities and abstractions for the construction of large-scale distributed IOT applications [4]. Bohli et al. state in one of their theses: The value of the IoT market grows more than linearly with the number of consumers. This thesis inherently assumes the value of 'connectedness' of the network [1]. One supporting experience with 'connectedness' that follows such thesis in a favourable way is with social networks, e. g. facebook, twitter etc [2]. Scharmen argues similarly from more abstract view that spaces, physical, virtual or physical-virtual are just culture containers, for people to present, curate, mediate via these interconnections [5].",

For example, users can be provided with information and services just by approaching to them or pointing to them with a mobile device. This kind of interactions can improve business processes by reducing the gap between physical and digital spaces. This work presents Parkour, a design method for workflows that make use of implicit interactions. Parkour allows designers to indicate how implicit interactions can be orchestrated to support a workflow. Furthermore, reconfiguration techniques have been applied to adapt at run-time the degree in which these interactions intrude the user's mind. Tool support has been developed to automate the validation of the workflow models and support the system reconfiguration. Finally, the proposal has been applied in the development of several workflows.",

This paper first introduces a design method for event-driven business processes based on an integrative event ontology.

      "Title": "Steam-powered Sensing",
      "Abstract": "Sensornets promise to extend automated monitoring and control into industrial processes. In spite of great progress made in sensornet design, installation and operational costs can impede their widespread adoption---current practices of infrequent, manual observation are often seen as sufficient and more cost effective than automation, even for key business processes. In this paper we present two new approaches to reduce these costs, and we apply those approaches to rapidly detect blockages in steam pipelines of a production oilfield. First, we eliminate the high cost of bringing power to the field by generating electricity from heat, exploiting the high temperature of the very pipelines we monitor. We demonstrate that for temperature differences of 80 °C or more, we are able to sustain sensornet operation without grid electricity or batteries. Second, we show that non-invasive sensing can reduce the cost of sensing by avoiding sensors that pierce the pipeline and have high installation cost with interruption to production. Our system instead uses surface temperature to infer full or partial blockages in steam pipelines and full blockages in hot water pipelines. Finally, we evaluate our \"steam-powered sensing\" system to monitor potential blockages in steam pipeline chokes at a production oilfield. We also show the generality of our algorithm by applying it to detect water pipeline blockages in our lab. To our knowledge, this paper describes the first field-tested deployment of an industrial sensornet that employs non-solar energy harvesting.",

      "Abstract": "Predictive environmental sensor networks provide complex engineering and systems challenges. These systems must withstand the event of interest, remain functional over long time periods when no events occur, cover large geographical regions of interest to the event, and support the variety of sensor types needed to detect the phenomenon. Prediction of the phenomenon on the network complicates the system further, requiring additional computation on themicrocontrollers and utilizing prediction models that are not typically designed for sensor networks. This paper describes a system architecture and deployment to meet the design requirements and to allow model-driven control, thereby optimizing the prediction capability of the system. We explore the application of river flood prediction using this architecture, describing our work on a centralized form of the prediction model, network implementation, component testing and infrastructure development in Honduras, deployment on a river in Massachusetts, and results of the field experiments. Our system uses only a small number of nodes to cover basins of 1000-10000 square km2 using an unique heterogeneous communication structure to provide real-time sensed data, incorporating self-monitoring for failure, and adapting measurement schedules to capture events of interest.",

      "Abstract": "Recent advances in embedded systems and mobile technologies are paving the way for the next revolution in computing, Ubiquitous Computing, the future towards which all the current technological developments are heading. Ubiquitous computing has potential applications in several sectors such as healthcare, business processes, disaster mitigation and management, farm land irrigation, and empowering the common man to improve the quality of life. Wireless communication modules and sensors are major building blocks of ubiquitous computing paradigm. As the field of communication networks continues to evolve, a very interesting and challenging area of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is rapidly coming of age. Wireless sensor networks are attractive means to monitor environmental conditions and to bridge the gap between the physical and the digital world. Wireless Sensor Networks are highly distributed networks of small, lightweight wireless nodes deployed in large numbers in-situ to monitor the environment or a system. The nodes cooperate and collaborate on their data, which leads to accurate sensing of events in the environment.",

      "Title": "Model-driven Data Acquisition in Sensor Networks",
      "Abstract": "Declarative queries are proving to be an attractive paradigm for ineracting with networks of wireless sensors. The metaphor that \"the sensornet is a database\" is problematic, however, because sensors do not exhaustively represent the data in the real world. In order to map the raw sensor readings onto physical reality, a model of that reality is required to complement the readings. In this paper, we enrich interactive sensor querying with statistical modeling techniques. We demonstrate that such models can help provide answers that are both more meaningful, and, by introducing approximations with probabilistic confidences, significantly more efficient to compute in both time and energy. Utilizing the combination of a model and live data acquisition raises the challenging optimization problem of selecting the best sensor readings to acquire, balancing the increase in the confidence of our answer against the communication and data acquisition costs in the network. We describe an exponential time algorithm for finding the optimal solution to this optimization problem, and a polynomial-time heuristic for identifying solutions that perform well in practice. We evaluate our approach on several real-world sensor-network data sets, taking into account the real measured data and communication quality, demonstrating that our model-based approach provides a high-fidelity representation of the real phenomena and leads to significant performance gains versus traditional data acquisition techniques.",

      "Title": "Towards a Framework for Safety Analysis of Body Sensor Networks",
      "Abstract": "\n\nBody sensor networks (BSNs) are an emerging class of medical cyber-physical systems which have the potential to change the healthcare paradigm. However, they present many new challenges, chief of which (like any medical device) is assuring patient safety. This requires not only a precise definition of safety, but also techniques for assessing the safety of BSN designs. Although solutions are possible and important for specific BSNs used in specific applications, addressing this issue on a case-by-case basis usually results in an ad-hoc process, and more importantly, makes the translation of experiences and solutions between different applications more difficult.\n\nA generic and conceptual framework for guiding the safety analysis process would provide all stakeholders a common basis for communicating, discussing, and examining the safety of BSN designs, and provide manufacturers with an exemplary process that they can follow to improve and gain confidence in the safety of their devices. This paper presents our current efforts in developing such a framework. In particular, we present a theoretical foundation for modeling and analyzing BSNs, and identify the general class of hazards based on this foundation. These efforts explore critical issues that deserve attention in designing safe BSN systems, and more importantly, can help advance the understanding of BSNs and their safety.\n",

      "Abstract": "Even as the use of sensor networks to support mobile applications grows, our ability to seamlessly and efficiently incorporate sensor network capabilities into our mobile applications remains astoundingly difficult. Today, accessing remote sensing data and integrating this data into the adaptive behavior of a dynamic user-facing mobile application requires interacting with multiple platforms, languages, data formats, and communication paradigms. We present BraceForce, an open and extensible middleware that allows developers to access the myriad remote sensing capabilities inherent to today’s mobile computing spaces (where mobile devices and sensors are closely integrated) using very minimal code. Further, BraceForce incorporates event- and model-driven data acquisition as first-class concepts to provide efficient access to sensing while retaining expressiveness and flexibility for applications. We present the BraceForce architecture and key abstractions, describe their implementations, and provide an empirical study using BraceForce to support mobile applications integrating sensing.",

      "Abstract": "Dependability and fault-tolerance, which are key requirements for business- or safety-critical applications, require explicit knowledge of potential faults that may occur within a system. In contrast to other major research directions, the emerging field of distributed event-based systems is yet lacking a common understanding of faults. In this paper we take a step forward and study potential origins and effects of faults in such systems. Our work on a unified fault taxonomy follows a rigorous methodology. We first identify five core sub-areas in the broader field of event-based systems, and discuss commonalities and differences among them. Then we derive from the existing literature a coherent domain model, which accurately captures the specifics of the different areas. The domain model provides a holistic view and covers both structural and procedural aspects of event-based systems. Based on this model, we elaborate a detailed taxonomy of faults, in line with well-established fault dimensions from dependable and secure computing. The fault taxonomy forms the basis for a comprehensive discussion of fault instances across the five sub-areas of event processing.",

      "Title": "Bringing Multi-antenna Gain to Energy-constrained Wireless Devices",
      "Abstract": "\n\nLeveraging the redundancy and parallelism from multiple RF chains, MIMO technology can easily scale wireless link capacity. However, the high power consumption and circuit-area cost prevents MIMO from being adopted by energy-constrained wireless devices. In this paper, we propose Halma, that can boost link capacity using multiple antennas but a single RF chain, thereby, consuming the same power as SISO. While modulating its normal data symbols, a Halma transmitter hops between multiple passive antennas on a per-symbol basis. The antenna hopping pattern implicitly carriers extra data, which the receiver can decode by extracting the index of the active antenna using its channel pattern as a signature.\n\nWe design Halma by intercepting the antenna switching and channel estimation modules in modern wireless systems, including ZigBee and WiFi. Further, we design a model-driven antenna hopping protocol to balance a tradeoff between link quality and dissimilarity of channel signatures. Remarkably, by leveraging the inherent packet structure in ZigBee, Halma's link capacity can scale well with the number of antennas. Using the WARP software radio, we have implemented Halma along with a ZigBee- and WiFi-based PHY layer. Our experiments demonstrate that Halma can improve ZigBee's throughput and energy efficiency by multiple folds under realistic network settings. For WiFi, it consumes similar power as SISO, but boosts throughput across a wide range of link conditions and modulation levels.\n",

      "Abstract": "Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) or Internet of Things systems are typically formed by a myriad of many small interconnected devices. This underlying hardware infrastructure raises new challenges in the way we administrate the software layer of these systems. Indeed, the limited computing power and battery life of each node combined with the very distributed nature of these systems, greatly adds complexity to distributed software layer management. In this paper we propose a new middleware dedicated to CPS to enable the management of software deployment and the dynamic reconfiguration of these systems. Our middleware is inspired from the Component Based Systems and the model@runtime paradigm which has been adapted to the context of Cyber Physical Systems. We have conducted an initial evaluation on a typical Cyber Physical Systems hardware infrastructure which demonstrates the feasibility of providing a model@runtime middleware for these systems.",

      "Title": "Utilising Bitemporal Information for Business Process Contingency Management",
      "Abstract": "In today's enterprise environment, business processes no longer operate in an isolated fashion, driven purely by human input. Instead, they exchange information across organisations as well as interacting directly with sensors and actuators in the Internet of Things. This means that traditional assumptions about processes having a \"perfect\" view of the world no longer hold as real world events affect prior plans. Critical decisions must be made based on temporal information of events which potentially lead to reconfiguration of business processes to provide the desired service within specified time limits. Currently, temporal aspects of business processes only consider events in a single time dimension. However, recent architectures such as modern database systems are starting to provide the capabilities for handling two time dimensions. In this paper, we investigate how the impact of a change in an event can be identified using bitemporal information from business events. We take into consideration the underlying data model as well as behaviour specifications in the form of artifact lifecycles. Identifying the impact will enable us to tailor appropriate process adaptions as a result of event time changes.",

      "Abstract": "Future Internet and Service Mashups provide novel infrastructures linked to objects, services and things of the real world to meet the changing global needs of business and society. Thanks to them, integration of data and services worldwide distributed are more easily accessible, reachable and usable. The synergy existing among Adaptive Services for Future Internet and Web APIs and Service Mashups have provided us with the chance of celebrating these two workshops together and publishing these joined proceedings for those researches and developers interested on these supplementary fields.\nFuture Internet has emerged as a new initiative to pave a novel infrastructure linked to objects and things of the real world to meet the changing global needs of business and society. Technologies such as those based on XML and RDF or OWL to describe data and semantic information, SOAP or REST to define protocols and BPEL or BPMN to orchestrate business processes are being increasingly used to specify Future Internet services in a standardized manner, which will allow software and data no longer to be stored and distributed on individual computers. Instead, multitenancy will enable their remote access as Software as a Service (SaaS), even by performing the integration into larger networks of communicating software (e.g., a mashup or a plug-in to a Cloud platform). Future Internet applications will have to support the interoperability between many diverse stakeholders by governing the convergence and life-cycle of Internet of Contents (IoC), Services (IoS), Things (IoT), and Networks (IoN). In this sense, there is a need for both researchers and practitioners to develop platforms made up of adaptive Future Internet applications. Hence, the emergence and consolidation of Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA), Cloud Computing and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) rise benefits, such as flexibility, scalability, security, interoperability, and adaptability, for building these applications.\n",

      "Abstract": "\n\nIn several applications such as databases, planning, and sensor networks, parameters such as selectivity, load, or sensed values are known only with some associated uncertainty. The performance of such a system (as captured by some objective function over the parameters) is significantly improved if some of these parameters can be probed or observed. In a resource constrained situation, deciding which parameters to observe in order to optimize system performance itself becomes an interesting and important optimization problem. This problem is the focus of this paper. Unfortunately designing optimal observation schemes is NP-HARD even for the simplest objective functions, leading to the study of approximation algorithms.\n\nIn this paper we present general techniques for designing non-adaptive probing algorithms which are at most a constant factor worse than optimal adaptive probing schemes. Interestingly, this shows that for several problems of interest, while probing yields significant improvement in the objective function, being adaptive about the probing is not beneficial beyond constant factors.\n",

      "Abstract": "Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are revolutionizing oceanography through their versatility, autonomy and endurance. However, they are still an underutilized technology. For coastal operations, the ability to track a certain feature is of interest to ocean scientists. Adaptive and predictive path planning requires frequent communication with significant data transfer. Currently, most AUVs rely on satellite phones as their primary communication. This communication protocol is expensive and slow. To reduce communication costs and provide adequate data transfer rates, we present the hardware and software components that make up a communication framework, which provides robust, disruption-tolerant, cost-effective glider operation for a coastal region. The framework is specifically designed to address multi-sensor deployments. We provide a system overview and present testing and coverage data for the network. Additionally, we include an application of ocean-model driven trajectory design, which can benefit from the use of this network and communication system. The presented combination of infrastructure, software development and deployment experience brings us closer to the goal of providing a reliable and cost-effective data transfer framework to enable real-time, optimal trajectory design, based on ocean model predictions, to gather in situ measurements of interesting and evolving ocean features and phenomena.",

In real life there will be situations where the inhabitant receives visits from family members or professional health care givers. In such cases activity recognition is unreliable. In this paper, we investigate the problem of detecting multiple persons in an environment equipped with a sensor network consisting of binary sensors. We conduct a real-life experiment for detection of visits in the office of the supervisor where the office is equipped with a video camera to record the ground truth. We collected data during two months and used two models, a Naive Bayes Classifier and a Hidden Markov Model for a visitor detection. An evaluation of these two models shows that we achieve an accuracy of 83% with the NBC and an accuracy of 92% with a HMM, respectively.",

      "Abstract": "In several database applications, parameters like selectivities and load are known only with some associated uncertainty, which is specified, or modeled, as a distribution over values. The performance of query optimizers and monitoring schemes can be improved by spending resources like time or bandwidth in observing or resolving these parameters, so that better query plans can be generated. In a resource-constrained situation, deciding which parameters to observe in order to best optimize the expected quality of the plan generated (or in general, optimize the expected value of a certain objective function) itself becomes an interesting optimization problem.We present a framework for studying such problems, and present several scenarios arising in anomaly detection in complex systems, monitoring extreme values in sensor networks, load shedding in data stream systems, and estimating rates in wireless channels and minimum latency routes in networks, which can be modeled in this framework with the appropriate objective functions.Even for several simple objective functions, we show the problems are Np-Hard. We present greedy algorithms with good performance bounds. The proof of the performance bounds are via novel sub-modularity arguments.",

DEBS is the flagship conference for the dissemination of original research, demonstration of prototypes, the discussion of new practical insights, and the reporting of relevant experience relating to event-based computing. Event-based systems have gained in importance in many application domains, ranging from real-time data processing in web environments, nontraditional applications, such as railroad safety and track monitoring, logistics and networking, to complex event processing in finance and security. The event-based paradigm strengthened by continuous stream data processing has gathered momentum as witnessed by current efforts in areas such as event-driven architectures, big data systems, the internet of things, complex event processing, publish/subscribe systems, business process management, cloud computing, web services, information dissemination, and message-oriented middleware. The DEBS conference brings researchers, students, and practitioners from these various communities together in an international setting to exchange ideas and knowledge about current research work and open challenges. The conference also provides a forum for facilitating the exchange of ideas between academics, vendors, and application developers.\n\nThe call for scientific papers attracted 58 submissions from Asia, Canada, Europe, and the United States. The program committee accepted 16 papers that cover a variety of topics, including distributed stream processing, publish/subscribe systems, complex event processing models and languages, and mobility and query optimization. The technical program is complemented by three keynotes talks provided by Roger Barga (Microsoft Research), David Wollman (National Institute of Standards and Technology), and Shailendra Mishra (Paypal). Roger Barga addresses the need for batch-oriented analytics engines that are supported by storage and data processing engines such as Hadoop to also provide real-time analytics capabilities. David Wollman outlines the role of stream and event processing for the Smart Grid and other cyber-physical systems applications. Finally, Shailendra Mishra describes the challenges of complex event processing as a supporting technology for the data cloud and cloud services framework. In addition, Jennifer Maxwell (BNSF Railway) presents an invited experience report on the use of event-based technology for the development of an advanced railroad application.\n\nTo place emphasis on the practical use of event-based technologies in distributed environments, the Grand Challenge competition provides a showcase of event-based solutions to problems that are relevant to industry at large using real-life data and queries. This year's challenge involved demonstrating the applicability of event-based systems for real-time analytics over high velocity sensor data collected from a soccer game. In addition to the Grand Challenge competition, demonstration and poster sessions provide an opportunity for groups of students, researchers, and practitioners to showcase their prototypes and research for an international audience. The Doctoral Workshop also acts as a meeting place for students to discuss their research and obtain meaningful feedback as well as interaction with experts in the field.\n",

Here, we cover devices and gateways, local and wide area networking, data management, business processes, cloud and analytics technologies. Devices form the basis of the Internet of Things and provide functions for sensing and actuating in the physical world. Local and wide area networking provides these with the necessary infrastructure to connect to services, using Wireless Sensor Networks to form multi-hop architectures with gateway sensor nodes that provides WAN connectivity towards the backhaul network. Data management handles essential functions such as data acquisition, validation and storage, and makes sure that critical information is available at the right point in a timely manner, and in the right form. Business processes refers to the series of steps to perform management, operational and supporting activities for achieving specific mission objectives. XaaS is used as a general term to describe the functions provided as-a-service by cloud infrastructures, such as computational capacity, software, networking and storage. Analytics are used to extract additional value from data generated by devices and enable new opportunities by using data from devices for multiple purposes, most of which will not be imagined at the time of deployment. Knowledge Management Frameworks provides functions that provide the ability to understand data-generated information and use existing experience within a certain decision-making context",

      "Abstract": "In this article we present a software development methodology and a supporting algorithm toolbox for Organic Computing applications that were developed in the context of the MODOC project. We focus on control applications for dynamic actuator/sensor networks that have no skilled human administrator and that are subject to frequent random hardware failures. To deal with these characteristics, applications in this setting should be self-organising and self-stabilising. However, realising self-organising and self-stabilising applications is usually a complex task requiring expert knowledge. Thus, we show that the development of such applications can be greatly simplified by shifting complexity into a model-driven tool chain. Developers implement their application in a high-level language based on a role abstraction focusing on application functionality. In order to hide the remaining complexity, we developed a tool chain which is responsible for transforming the high-level code to executable machine code that is automatically enriched by self-x properties such as self-organisation and self-stabilisation, which are not explicitly defined by the application programmer. Thereby, the application benefits from extended fault-tolerance and availability. A&nbsp;major part of the tool chain is a toolbox containing self-x algorithms commonly required for Organic Computing applications. The heart of the toolbox is an algorithm stack realised by our publish/subscribe middleware <span class=\"a-plus-plus emphasis type-small-caps\">Rebeca</span> that is able to efficiently realise self-organisation even in case of large networks.Model-driven development, Publish/subscribe, Self-stabilisation, Self-organisation, Actuator and sensor networks, Composite event detection, Adaptive routing, ",

These Smart Items deliver the data to realize the accurate real-time representation of ’things’ within the information systems. In particular for supply chain applications this allows monitoring and control throughout the entire process involving suppliers, customers and shippers. However, the problem remains what Smart Item technology should be favored in a concrete application in order to implement the Internet of Things most suitable. This paper analyzes different types of Smart Item technology within a typical logistics scenario. We develop a quantification cost model for Smart Items in order to evaluate the different views of the supplier, customer and shipper. Finally, we conclude a criterion, which supports decision makers to estimate the benefit of the Smart Items. Our approach is justified using performance numbers from a supply chain case with perishable goods. Further, we investigate the model through a selection of model parameters, e.g. the technology price, fix costs and utility, and illustrate them in a second use case. We also provide guidelines how to estimate parameters for use in our cost formula to ensure practical applicability of the model. The overall results reveal that the model is highly adaptable to various use cases and practical.",

      "Abstract": "Declarative queries are proving to be an attractive paradigm for interacting with networks of wireless sensors. The metaphor that “the sensornet is a database” is problematic, however, because sensors do not exhaustively represent the data in the real world. In order to map the raw sensor readings onto physical reality, a <em class=\"a-plus-plus\">model</em> of that reality is required to complement the readings. In this article, we enrich interactive sensor querying with statistical modeling techniques. We demonstrate that such models can help provide answers that are both more meaningful, and, by introducing approximations with probabilistic confidences, significantly more efficient to compute in both time and energy. Utilizing the combination of a model and live data acquisition raises the challenging optimization problem of selecting the best sensor readings to acquire, balancing the increase in the confidence of our answer against the communication and data acquisition costs in the network. We describe an exponential time algorithm for finding the optimal solution to this optimization problem, and a polynomial-time heuristic for identifying solutions that perform well in practice. We evaluate our approach on several real-world sensor-network datasets, taking into account the real measured data and communication quality, demonstrating that our model-based approach provides a high-fidelity representation of the real phenomena and leads to significant performance gains versus traditional data acquisition techniques.Sensor networks, Approximate querying, Probabilistic models, Conditional plans, Model-driven data acquisition, ",

This makes it obvious that multi-technology topologies, security and mobility support will be prevalent in 6LoWPAN. Mobility based communication increases the connectivity, and allows extending and adapting LoWPANs to changes in their location and environment infrastructure. However, the required mobility is heavily dependent on the individual service scenario and the LoWPAN architecture. In this context, an optimized solution is proposed for critical applications, such as military, fire rescue or healthcare, where people need to frequently change their position. Our scenario is health monitoring in an oil refinery where many obstacles have been found to the effective use of LoWPANs in these scenarios, mainly due to transmission medium features i.e. high losses, high latency and low reliability. Therefore, it is very difficult to provide continuous health monitoring with such stringent requirements on mobility. In this paper, a paradigm is proposed for mobility over 6LoWPAN for critical environments. On the one hand the intra-mobility is supported by GinMAC, which is an extension of IEEE 802.15.4 to support a topology control algorithm, which offers intra-mobility transparently, and <a href=\"/search?dc.title=Movement+Direction&amp;facet-content-type=ReferenceWorkEntry&amp;sortOrder=relevance\" class=\"reference-link webtrekk-track\" gacategory=\"Internal link\" galabel=\"Movement Direction\" gaaction=\"reference keyword\">Movement Direction</a> Determination (MDD) of the Mobile Node (MN). On the other hand, the inter-mobility is based on pre-set-up of the network parameters in the visited networks, such as Care of Address and channel, to reach a fast and smooth handoff. Pre-set-up is reached since MDD allows discovering the next 6LoWPAN network towards which MN is moving. The proposed approach has been simulated, prototyped, evaluated, and is being studied in a scenario of wearable physiological monitoring in hazardous industrial areas, specifically oil refineries, in the scope of the GinSeng European project.6LoWPAN, Mobility, Topology control, Wireless Sensor Networks, ",

      "Abstract": "In the recent technological world, different kinds of stress have been faced by the human. These survival methods ultimately end up with problems such as stress and strain. The existing systems in avoiding the stress management facilitated the early detection of high blood pressure and other epidemical parameters. In this paper, we propose a system which is capable of computing stress levels and the mood of a human by the blood pressure measurement (BPM). The BPM value and pulse rate value is fed to the mobile phone which does the analyzing part and helps the human to be aware of oneâ€™s own stress level and blood pressure. According to the stress level a human face, the relaxation technique is designed on the basis of the human interest. Itâ€™s made available on the mobile phone itself. The relaxation technique may be like listening to audio, watch a video, watch a joke, and hear motivational or inspirational speech, etc. that would help to reduce the stress caused to the human. The human personal information, the daily BPM and analysis are stored in the remote server for online help. The doctor or any health-care taker is allowed to access this. So the human can access their BP analysis through online, can post queries regarding their health problems and the health-care taker would reply them. Initially a survey has been conducted on the use of the electronic gadgets by the stress faced by the humans and also another survey from doctors to know exactly the reason behind the stress of the persons regarding such cases of stress management. In this paper we detail the stress level and the corresponding self relaxation technique. Initial experimentation with heuristic algorithms on sensor network oriented SLReduct framework shown the interesting results.",

Starting from a set of events generated by sensors and business processes (BPs), we propose a methodology for multiple process annotation. From the analysis of the events correlations, we can discover interconnections among processes of several organizations involved in the same goal and derived additional information about the processes being executed.

      "Abstract": "The emerging information technology of internet of things (IoT) has caught much attention from both theoretical research and production practice. The application of IoT in manufacturing industry can dramatically improve business process efficiency and promote organizational performance. However, firms tend to hesitate in the investment decisions, which poses great challenges to the IoT application progress. Besides the investment nature of long cycle and high risk, the â€œorganizational factorsâ€ are also non-ignorable. A general organizational change model is first refined according to the organizational change of Jianghuai Auto Company when applying IoT. Based on the binomial lattice tree framework, we propose a two-stage real options model to solve the optimal investment problems in both stages of internal pilot and product life-cycle management (PLM) expansion. Investment costs and future benefits are considered to investigate the promoting effect of organizational factors in project implementation. This paper demonstrates the internal causes and significances of organizational change for IoT development project, which is also theoretically meaningful for explanation of real options approach in organizational area.",

In this paper we consider the verification of system behaviour and resource requirements for distributed rule-based systems. More specifically, we consider distributed problem-solving in systems of communicating rule-based systems, and ask how much time (measured as the number of rule firings) and message exchanges does it take the system to find a solution. We show how standard model-checking technology can be used to verify resource requirements for such systems, and present preliminary results which highlight complex tradeoffs between time and communication bounds.",

      "Abstract": "Future wireless sensor networks are expected to provide various sensing services and energy efficiency is one of the most important criterions. The node scheduling strategy aims to increase network lifetime by selecting a set of sensor nodes to provide the required sensing services in a periodic manner. In this paper, we are concerned with the service-oriented node scheduling problem to provide multiple sensing services while maximizing the network lifetime. We firstly introduce how to model the data correlation for different services by using Markov Random Field (MRF) model. Secondly, we formulate the service-oriented node scheduling issue into three different problems, namely, the multi-service data denoising problem which aims at minimizing the noise level of sensed data, the representative node selection problem concerning with selecting a number of active nodes while determining the services they provide, and the multi-service node scheduling problem which aims at maximizing the network lifetime. Thirdly, we propose a Multi-service Data Denoising (MDD) algorithm, a novel multi-service Representative node Selection and service Determination (RSD) algorithm, and a novel MRF-based Multi-service Node Scheduling (MMNS) scheme to solve the above three problems respectively. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme efficiently extends the network lifetime.",

      "Abstract": "Predictable behavior of wireless sensor networks calls for deterministic protocols for network-wide synchronization and collision-free frame transmissions. Furthermore, the execution of these protocols requires tight scheduling under real-time constraints. In previous work, we have devised a framework called BiPS (Black-burst-Integrated Protocol Stack), which provides these functionalities. To achieve the required real-time behavior, BiPS has been implemented manually on bare hardware.Higher-layer functionalities such as routing protocols or sensor applications are far less time-critical. Therefore, we strive for applying model-driven development, using SDL as abstract modeling language, and commercial tool environments to automatically generate implementations. In this paper, we present how we incorporate implementations generated with PragmaDev's Real-time Developer Studio (RTDS) into BiPS. Therefore, we have modified and extended the RTDS transition scheduler, and have placed it under the control of the BiPS scheduler. Furthermore, based on RTDS concepts, we have implemented an SDL environment that can access BiPS functionality, e.g., protocols of the MAC layer or hardware devices. In experiments on a wireless sensor node, we have demonstrated that our integration is fully operational and has advantages regarding efficiency and predictability.",

In this paper, we propose a multi-model based range query processing algorithm, which utilizes multiple probability models to improve the accuracy and saves the energy consumption of the single model based algorithms. We conduct experiments on real dataset. The experimental results show that the multi-model based algorithm can save more energy than that consumed by the single model based algorithm.",

Motivated by the issues, this paper provides an insight and approach to develop high quality communication frameworks for IoT data test-bed, based on LTE communications systems. The test-bed framework is achieved by featuring an emulation of EPC construction using NetFPGA and OpenFlow platforms. The test-bed model will be expected to offer the sensitiveness control over IoT communication data type. In addition the emulation scheme provided by this test-bed will allow an extensive achievement toward M2M over LTE compliance for IoT integrated architecture in the near future.",

      "Abstract": "Business method patents represent a new and very serious challenge for technology management in the logistics industry, in particular for internationally operating companies. To provide some case-related insight into this field, we intend to analyse the utilisation of such patents in the context of intelligent sensor networks. We are going to develop several hypotheses and propose a workflow-based approach to patent analysis, comprising1 the systematic analysis of a business process2 the use of its functions for the identification of relevant patent documents.One major finding is that relatively few logistics companies are active in this patent field. Accordingly - and this can be regarded as a challenge, which might apply to other industries as well - technology management in the analysed field has to balance between using inventions that are patented by its suppliers and subcontractors and patenting business methods of its own. If the latter is neglected, it might miss a major opportunity to deal with asymmetries in the international patent system, gain advantages and secure its companies' freedom to operate.",

Our focus is on the model where the random matrices have independent but time-variant distribution. We introduce a new phenomenon, the infinite flow, and we study its fundamental properties and relations with the ergodicity and consensus. The central result is the infinite flow theorem establishing the equivalence between the infinite flow and the ergodicity for a class of independent random models, where the matrices in the model have a common steady state in expectation and a feedback property. For such models, this result demonstrates that the expected infinite flow is both necessary and sufficient for the ergodicity. The result is providing a deterministic characterization of the ergodicity, which can be used for studying the consensus and average consensus over random graphs.",

      "Abstract": "This work presents a power-efficient wireless sensor implemented using microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based dry electrodes (MDE) and a ZigBee protocol chip for physiological signal acquisition. To improve signal quality with low electrode-skin interface impedance, a silicon-based MDE is fabricated via micromachining technology. The proposed wireless sensor can provide four different channels for up to 10 kHz bandwidth, 10-bit resolution biomedical signal transmissions. Different from other systems, the proposed wireless sensor employs a novel power management method for physiological signals to reduce power consumption. The proposed wireless sensor successfully transmits electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and four-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals with power consumptions of 92.7 and 56.8 mW respectively. It consumes 46% less power than the original sensor without power management (173 mW) in ECG acquisition and 67% less power in EEG acquisition. The circuit printed-circuit-band area in the proposed wireless sensor is 3.5 x 4.5 cm, suitable for various portable biomedical applications.

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first who proposed the notion of autonomic sensor grid systems in a holistic manner, aiming at non-trivial large applications. To bridge the gap between the physical world and the digital world and facilitate information analysis and decision making, ASGrid is designed to smooth the integration of sensor networks and grid systems and efficiently use both on demand. Under the blueprint of ASGrid, we present several building blocks that fulfill the following major features: (1) self-configuration through content-based aggregation and associative rendezvous mechanisms; (2) self-optimisation through utility-based sensor selection, model-driven hierarchical sensing task scheduling and auction-based game-theoretic approach for grid scheduling; (3) self-protection through ActiveKey dynamic key management and S3Trust trust management mechanisms. Experimental and simulation results on these aspects are presented.",

      "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new routing scheme based on multi-path routing which provides uniform energy consumption for all nodes. This scheme adds a new type of root node for constructing multi-path. The sink node delegates some partial roles to these root nodes. Such root nodes carry out path establishment independently. As a result, each nodes consume energy more uniformly and the network life-time will be extended. Through simulation, we confirmed that energy consumption of the whole network is scattered and the network life-time is extended. Moreover, we show that the proposed routing scheme improves the performance of network compared to previous routing strategies as the number of source nodes increases.",

      "Title": "Distributed sensor data compression algorithm",
      "Abstract": "Theoretically it is possible for two sensors to reliably send data at rates smaller than the sum of the necessary data rates for sending the data independently, essentially taking advantage of the correlation of sensor readings to reduce the data rate. In 200 1, Caltech researchers Michelle Effros and Qian Zhao developed new techniques for data compression code design for correlated sensor data, which were published in a paper at the 2001 Data Compression Conference (DCC 2001). These techniques take advantage of correlations between two or more closely positioned sensors in a distributed sensor network. Given two signals, X and Y, the X signal is sent using standard data compression. The goal is to design a partition tree for the Y signal. The Y signal is sent using a code based on the partition tree. At the receiving end, if ambiguity arises when using the partition tree to decode the Y signal, the X signal is used to resolve the ambiguity. We have extended this work to increase the efficiency of the code search algorithms. Our results have shown that development of a highly integrated sensor network protocol that takes advantage of a correlation in sensor readings can result in 20-30% sensor data transport cost savings. In contrast, the best possible compression using state-of-the-art compression techniques that did not take into account the correlation of the incoming data signals achieved only 9-10% compression at most. This work was sponsored by MDA, but has very widespread applicability to ad hoc sensor networks, hyperspectral imaging sensors and vehicle health monitoring sensors for space applications.",

      "Abstract": "In the near future, the Internet of Things is expected to penetrate all aspects of the physical world, including homes and urban spaces. In order to handle the massive amount of data that becomes collectible and to offer services on top of this data, the most convincing solution is the federation of the Internet of Things and cloud computing. Yet, the wide adoption of this promising vision, especially for application areas such as pervasive health care, assisted living, and smart cities, is hindered by severe privacy concerns of the individual users. Hence, user acceptance is a critical factor to turn this vision into reality. To address this critical factor and thus realize the cloud-based Internet of Things for a variety of different application areas, we present our comprehensive approach to privacy in this envisioned setting. We allow an individual user to enforce all her privacy requirements before any sensitive data is uploaded to the cloud, enable developers of cloud services to integrate privacy functionality already into the development process of cloud services, and offer users a transparent and adaptable interface for configuring their privacy requirements.

      "Title": "A Study on the establishment of IoT management process in terms of business according to Paradigm Shift",
      "Abstract": "This study examined the concepts of the Internet of Things(IoT), the major issue and IoT trend in the domestic and international market. also reviewed the advent of IoT era which caused a ‘Paradigm Shift’. This study proposed a solution for the appropriate corresponding strategy in terms of Enterprise. Global competition began in the IoT market. So, Businesses to be competitive and responsive, the government's efforts, as well as the efforts of companies themselves is needed. In particular, in order to cope with the dynamic environment appropriately, faster and more efficient strategy is required. In other words, proposed a management strategy that can respond the IoT competitive era on tipping point through the vision of paradigm shift. We forecasted and proposed the emergence of paradigm shift through a comparative analysis of past management paradigm and IoT management paradigm as follow; Ⅰ) Knowledge & learning oriented management, Ⅱ) Technology & innovation oriented management, Ⅲ) Demand driven management, Ⅳ) Global collaboration management. The Knowledge & learning oriented management paradigm is expected to be a new management paradigm due to the development of IT technology development and information processing technology. In addition to the rapid development such as IT infrastructure and processing of data, storage, knowledge sharing and learning has become more important. Currently Hardware-oriented management paradigm will be changed to the software-oriented paradigm. In particular, the software and platform market is a key component of the IoT ecosystem, has been estimated to be led by Technology & innovation oriented management. In 2011, Gartner announced the concept of \"Demand-Driven Value Networks(DDVN)\", DDVN emphasizes value of the whole of the network. Therefore, Demand driven management paradigm is creating demand for advanced process, not the process corresponding to the demand simply. Global collaboration management paradigm create the value creation through the fusion between technology, between countries, between industries. In particular, cooperation between enterprises that has financial resources and brand power and venture companies with creative ideas and technical will generate positive synergies. Through this, The large enterprises and small companies that can be win-win environment would be built. Cope with the a paradigm shift and to establish a management strategy of Enterprise process, this study utilized the ‘RTE cyclone model’ which proposed by Gartner. RTE concept consists of three stages, Lead, Operate, Manage. The Lead stage is utilizing capital to strengthen the business competitiveness. This stages has the goal of linking to external stimuli strategy development, also Execute the business strategy of the company for capital and investment activities and environmental changes. Manege stage is to respond appropriately to threats and internalize the goals of the enterprise. Operate stage proceeds to action for increasing the efficiency of the services across the enterprise, also achieve the integration and simplification of the process, with real-time data capture. RTE(Real Time Enterprise) concept has the value for practical use with the management strategy. Appropriately applied in this study, we propose a 'IoT-RTE Cyclone model' which emphasizes the agility of the enterprise. In addition, based on the real-time monitoring, analysis, act through IT and IoT technology. ‘IoT-RTE Cyclone model’ that could integrate the business processes of the enterprise each sector and support the overall service. therefore the model be used as an effective response strategy for Enterprise. In particular, IoT-RTE Cyclone Model is to respond to external events, waste elements are removed according to the process is repeated. Therefore, it is possible to model the operation of the process more efficient and agile. This IoT-RTE Cyclone Model can be used as an effective response strategy of the enterprise in terms of IoT era of rapidly changing because it supports the overall service of the enterprise. When this model leverages a collaborative system among enterprises it expects breakthrough cost savings through competitiveness, global lead time, minimizing duplication.",

      "Abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) makes it possible for us to sense the physical world and locate objects in it using the enabling technologies associated with IoT. Compared with traditional information systems, IoT enabling technologies can help acquire real-time data necessary for managing enterprise business process. An IoT system should have an ability beyond integrating enabling technologies and traditional information systems that are only used to access environmental data. This paper begins with a literature review of IoT-related issues and a discussion of the difference between traditional information service and IoT service. Three principles for IoT service design from the perceptive of service classification, coordination and compatibility are proposed. The paper also proposes a utility model for resource allocation in order to improve IoT service performance, and an application involving a cold chain visibility platform is given to illustrate our research.",

      "Title": "A data gathering MAC protocol based on state translation and grouping for WSN",
      "Abstract": "In order to decrease the delivery latency, increase the throughput and lower the traffic loads, this paper presents MDD-MAC (multi-divided deliver MAC), a new synchronous MAC protocol with low delivery latency and low traffic loads. MDD-MAC minimizes collisions and overhearing by dividing data transmission cycle into two time slots, i.e. data sending slot and data receiving slot. To achieve low latency and energy-efficiency, MDD-MAC introduces an efficient group deliver mechanism by combining the topology information of network. We evaluate MDD-MAC on OMNet++ and compare it with DW-MAC and TMAC, two previous energy-efficient MAC protocols, under the scenarios of cross network, random networks and grid networks. In all experiments, MDD-MAC significantly outperforms those other protocols. For example, on scenarios of cross network with 43 nodes, the delivery latency and maximum buffer load for MDD-MAC is 67.59% and 89.16% less than that of DW-MAC, and 72.49% and 89.80% less than that of TMAC respectively. Specially, the average collision times for DW-MAC and TMAC is 8 and 34 respectively while the MDD-MAC is almost zero.",

      "Abstract": "The paper presents a novel traceability system architecture based on web services, which are used to integrate traceability data captured through Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems with environmental data collected with Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) infrastructure. The solution, suitable to be deployed in Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs), is provided by integrating information collected along the entire food supply chain, tracking the products from the farm to the consumer. The results of the deployment of the novel system in two pilots in the aquaculture business are also presented, showcasing how business processes in the aquaculture supply chain can be improved by the architecture and flexibility of the new system, since the two companies involved in the project are of very different sizes. Additionally, we present an analysis of the benefits obtained by the introduction of the new system in the companies based on predefined objectives and the evaluation of KPIs. The evaluation of KPIs is presented as the time reduction of activities and can improve the Efficiency of the companies in 89-95%. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract": "Sensor data is modeled and Gaussian sum particle filter method is used for probabilistic inference based on model-driven methods for saving energy. First, the correlations on different sensor nodes and constructed probabilistic models from historical data are exploited. Then, the particle filter method is adopted to infer values for one sensor node from values acquired from real world by other sensor nodes, which saves energy of sensors efficiently. Finally, according to the fact that the sensor data generally satisfies Gaussian distribution, Gaussian particle filters and Gaussian sum particle filters are utilized for probabilistic inference respectively. Experiments show that the proposed Gaussian sum particle filter method is of high accuracy and efficiency.",

      "Abstract": "Health is an important factor of every human being. Remote health monitoring messenger is needed for the people to reduce their inconvenience in travel to hospitals due to ailing health. Ill-patient requires accurate decision to be taken immediately in critical situations, so that life-protecting and lifesaving therapy can be properly applied. In recent years, sensors are used in each and every fast developing application for designing the miniaturized system which is much easier for people use. A remote health monitoring messenger informs the doctor about the patient condition through wireless media such as Global System for Mobile communication. The system specifically deals with the signal conditioning and data acquisition of heart beat, temperature, and blood pressure of human body. The Heart beat sensor is used to read the patient's beats per minute (bpm) and temperature sensor to measure the body temperature of patient externally and pressure sensor to measure the level of pressure in blood. Signals obtained from sensors are fed into the microcontroller for processing and medicine is prescribed as first aid for patient to control the parameters through visual basic. A message is then sent to the doctor for further actions to be taken for treatment of patient after first aid. The system has a very good response time and it is cost effective.",

      "Abstract": "Modeling and simulation play important roles in engineering research and design. These techniques are especially helpful in the early phases where limited detail is available about the design and where design changes are less costly. In addition, high-fidelity models can be employed at the later stages to complement testing. Models are also important research tools for understanding complex phenomena.",

      "Abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a concept, which focuses on innovative commercial system implementations reflecting process-embedded events from the Internet of Things. The developed concepts are derived from experiences applying recent research advances to industry scenarios. The rationale behind the overall concept is twofold: while transparency is increased by event-based methodologies in the context of the Internet of Things, the agility of business processes is fostered by enhanced business process models, orchestration support, execution control, and user assistance.",

      "Abstract": "Traditional graph configuration software builds monitor screen by integrating user interface components in a block-building way. It is domain-specific, such as a graph configuration system for coal mine. And usually the control logic (also called business) of a graph configuration system for coal mine is not suitable for electricity, yet its user interface and control logic (also called business) are coupled together. In order to solve these problems this paper proposes a UI service composition method based on SCA (Service Component Architecture) and DTS (Domain, Task and Show) models. SCA is going to decouple business from user interface, while DTS is going to model user interface thinking about its reuse. Through experiments, we can see that this system not only can significantly reduce the cost of UI development by DTS, but also provide efficient support for users to participate in business processes. © 2011 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "In this paper we present a data-driven approach for the problem of approximate data collection in sensor networks within the disjoint clique framework. The objective is to obtain estimations of attribute values from sensor nodes within certain error bounds while spending minimal amount of energy. Chu et al.~\\cite{chu-icde06} showed that a disjoint clique model is a natural and effective way of exploiting temporal and spatial correlations in the attribute values. However their approach assumes the prior knowledge of probabilistic models representing the sensor data. This often seems to be a tedious task in real world deployments. This paper presents a data driven solution using disjoint clique model which does not assume any such prior knowledge. Using a preliminary experimental evaluation on a real life and a synthetic dataset, we show that the proposed data driven approach is feasible and is easy to deploy. © 2011 IEEE.",

      "Title": "An enhanced reservation-based medium access control with scheduling and admission control for voice over wireless mesh networks",
      "Abstract": "Voice over IEEE 802.11 networks is a cost-effective solution compared to cellular telephony in small areas and therefore considered among the killer applications of emergent Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs). However, traditional random medium access control (MAC) protocols used in IEEE 802.11-based WMNs, which are suitable for throughput-sensitive data services, are far from guaranteeing the low delays and the low packet losses required by voice traffic. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new enhanced MAC, called EMDA, combined with a simple scheduling and admission control algorithm, called SAC, that provides a high capacity and quality guarantees for voice over WMNs. EMDA improves significantly the optional Mesh Deterministic Access (MDA) MAC protocol, to provide a much higher voice call capacity thanks to voice packet aggregation and less MDA signaling overhead. EMDA is based on a per-node's radio interface transmission opportunity reservations that are well dimensioned. Moreover, we further improve the deterministic access of EMDA by proposing a jamming scheme that provides more robustness against interfering non-MDA nodes. The proposed SAC algorithm guarantees hard delay constraints and a uniform voice capacity over WMNs regardless of the number of hops to a gateway (i.e., a mesh router connecting WMN to Internet). Simulation results show that our proposed scheme provides a bigger voice capacity that is uniformly distributed over the WMN and a better performance in guaranteeing hard delay constraints and lower packet losses compared to other schemes. ©2010 IEEE.",

The novelty resides in the idea that an analysis of the outcomes of previous random model samplings can benefit subsequent samplings. Given a sequence of successful model samplings, information from the inlier sets and the model errors is used to provide a validness of a data point. This validness is used to guide subsequent model samplings, so that the data point with a higher validness has more chance to be selected. To evaluate the performance, the proposed method is applied to the problem of the line model fitting and the estimation of the fundamental matrix. Experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm improves the performance of RANSAC in terms of the estimate accuracy and the number of samplings. © 2010 Crown Copyright.",

      "Abstract": "Ubiquitous technologies such as sensor network and RFID have enabled companies to realize more rapid and agile manufacturing and service systems. In this paper, we addresses how the huge amount of real-time events coming from these devices can be filtered and integrated to business process such as manufacturing, logistics, and supply chain process. In particular, we focus on complex event processing of sensor and RFID events in order to integrate them to business rules in business activities. We also illustrate a ubiquitous event processing system, named ue- Filter, which helps to filter and aggregate sensor event, to detect event patterns from sensors and RFID by means of event pattern languages (EPL), and trigger event-condition-action (ECA) in logistics processes.

      "Title": "Digital platform for the next generation IO: A prerequisite for the high north",
      "Abstract": "The Arctic region holds vast amounts of extractive energy resources. Most of the arctic resources lie offshore beneath thick ice and deep water in environmentally very sensitive areas. Weather and distance from existing infrastructure and centers of population add additional operational and logistic challenges. Oil and gas operations in the high north are likely to entail the remote and distributed control of assets - leading to heavy demands on the communication links and information flow. Connecting and integrating business processes and information sources across disciplines, geographical locations and organizational boundaries add to the complexity. Further, operations in the high north require particular sensitivity to environmental aspects. In order to meet all the requirements and at the same time maintain profitable operations, the industry has to create new field development and operation concepts that include heavily instrumented facilities. There must also be put a significant focus on the transfer of real time data between fields and operation centers located elsewhere, and on automated key work processes to handle the large volumes of data. A prerequisite for this development is a robust digital infrastructure and a platform for effective and efficient information exchange. This is what the Norwegian Oil Industry Association has called Integrated Operations Generation 2. Central to this vision is a much higher degree of functionalities being distributed geographically and organizationally based upon a digital platform that is distributed to a higher extent than what is common today. The platform defines interfaces and employs data transfer and distributed intelligence based on open standards, allowing for a much higher degree of interoperability across applications, disciplines, geographic locations and organizations than is common today. The main aim for the \"Integrated Operations in the High North\" project is to build and demonstrate a digital platform for Integrated Operations Generation 2. The project is a unique collaboration between the ICT, defense and oil and gas industries, as well as university research groups. During a four year period starting May 2008, the 26 participants in the project are working together to develop a demonstrated platform for Integrated Operations Generation 2. Pilots defined for drilling, production and operations and maintenance, are used as a basis to generate the requirements early in the project, and at later stages in the project to demonstrate the value of the platform. The project is also relevant for gaining experience with where and how cutting edge ICT technologies, like semantic and agent technologies that target the \"Internet of things\", may generate value within the oil & gas industry.",

In this paper, we propose an approach to assess the trustworthiness of sensor data during their lifecycle, from acquisition at the nodes, through processing, to delivery to Business Applications. We rely on the subjective logic framework [10] to compute the probability that sensor data are trustworthy enough to be used by applications. With the definition of new operators for subjective logic, we develop a trust model, that allows to detect erroneous sensor data which are originated either unintentionally due to defective sensor nodes or intentionally by attackers. © 2009 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "Genetic programming (GP) is known to provide good solutions for many problems like the evolution of network protocols and distributed algorithms. In most cases it is a hardwired module of a design framework assisting the engineer in optimizing specific aspects in system development. In this article, we show how the utility of GP can be increased remarkably by isolating it as a component and integrating it into the model-driven software development process. Our GP framework produces XMI-encoded UML models that can easily be loaded into widely available modeling tools, which in turn offer code generation as well as additional analysis and test capabilities. We use the evolution of a distributed election algorithm as an example to illustrate how GP can be combined with model-driven development (MDD). © 2009 Imperial College Press.",

      "Title": "Financial distress prediction based on OR-CBR in the principle of k-nearest neighbors",
      "Abstract": "Financial distress prediction including bankruptcy prediction has called broad attention since 1960s. Various techniques have been employed in this area, ranging from statistical ones such as multiple discriminate analysis (MDA), Logit, etc. to machine learning ones like neural networks (NN), support vector machine (SVM), etc. Case-based reasoning (CBR), which is one of the key methodologies for problem-solving, has not won enough focus in financial distress prediction since 1996. In this study, outranking relations (OR), including strict difference, weak difference, and indifference, between cases on each feature are introduced to build up a new feature-based similarity measure mechanism in the principle of k-nearest neighbors. It is different from traditional distance-based similarity mechanisms and those based on NN, fuzzy set theory, decision tree (DT), etc. Accuracy of the CBR prediction method based on OR, which is called as OR-CBR, is determined directly by such four types of parameters as difference parameter, indifference parameter, veto parameter, and neighbor parameter. It is described in detail that what the model of OR-CBR is from various aspects such as its developed background, formalization of the specific model, and implementation of corresponding algorithm. With three year's real-world data from Chinese listed companies, experimental results indicate that OR-CBR outperforms MDA, Logit, NN, SVM, DT, Basic CBR, and Grey CBR in financial distress prediction, under the assessment of leave-one-out cross-validation and the process of Max normalization. It means that OR-CBR may be a preferred model dealing with financial distress prediction in China. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract": "The tracking of objects and humans has recently received a lot of attention as a tool to improve business processes, occupational and public safety. In industrial environments wireless sensor networks can facilitate deployment of tracking applications as they can establish a standalone communication infrastructure (a so called mesh network). Many such positioning and location tracking systems deploy a fixed infrastructure (so-called beacons) with known positions to determine the position of mobile nodes in the network. For large-scale deployments the installation effort of such systems may be a major cost-factor, as the exact position of each beacon needs to be manually determined and associated with map material. We therefore propose a position determination tool that automatically finds the positions of beacons based on the sensor network's topology, digital map material of the environment, and a small set of anchor nodes.",

      "Title": "A socio-technical approach to business process simulation",
      "Abstract": "This paper describes a socio-technical approach to business process redesign through the investigation of complex interactions and dependencies among humans and IT systems of organisations. The focus is on the need to assess business process performance early in the redesign process, to prevent organisational failures. The method is based on human performance quantification and is supported by a tool that enables scenario-based evaluation of prospective organisational processes through simulation. The approach combines probabilistic and subjective measures of tasks and communication acts in business processes to quantify business performance in terms of cycle time. The approach models business processes as a set of scenarios of sequential activities where the dependencies between actors, IT systems and tasks are explicitly defined. Business process performance assessment is achieved through a systematic walkthrough of the process model using these scenarios. Human performance constitutes an important parameter to business process performance and is modelled based on Human Performance Shaping Factors (PSF) and assessed using Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN). Process cycle time is calculated using aggregates of task and communication completion times, and calibrated using performance estimates of each of the agents in the scenario. The method enables trade-off analysis among candidate process models and identification of performance bottlenecks early in the design phase. A radiology process improvement case study is presented that demonstrates the use of the method and the tool. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract": "Business process integration has become a focus problem in the field of E-government. There exist a considerable unstructured business processes in E-government. These unstructured processes show the dynamic characteristics in runtime. Therefore, how to build the business process integration model to control and analysis these dynamic processes flexibly is a basic but important work. In this paper, firstly, based on business process management (BPM) framework, a corresponding conceptual model is proposed by integrating Pi-calculus and role network model (RNM). Then, the formal description of business processes is presented. The proposed model has two advantages. Firstly, the proposed model inherits the original idea of RNM and gives a highly abstract of organizations. Hence, it is suitable for the flexible control of governmental organizations and dynamic business processes. Secondly, the model is described formally by Pi-calculus so that it has characteristics of formalization and mobility. It is suitable to analyse and validate the dynamic processes. Finally, to demonstrate the feasibility, a practical example is given. © 2008 IEEE.",

      "Title": "Realizing value from real time well monitoring in BP's FIELD of the FUTURE program",
      "Abstract": "BP's FIELD OF THE FUTURE program makes use of in-well sensors, automation, and computer networks to move real time operations data to remote sites for analysis, enabling informed and faster intervention decisions. Realizing the value from such technology investments is not automatic, and requires an integrated approach to technology insertion that holistically addresses diverse issues of technology installation, stakeholder engagement and alignment, business process change, roles and skills as a managed project. We refer to this type of integrated approach applied to digital oil field developments as business transformation, which was described in outline in SPE 99779. This paper describes a recent case study from a Deepwater Gulf of Mexico field where there has been rapid and quantifiable business impact from the use of real time well data in the performing dynamic surveillance and allocating production processes. BP's proprietary Integrated Surveillance Information System (ISIS) was put into global deployment starting in 2006. The system delivers well performance data to field and office sites in near real time. To realize the value from the ISIS tool, asset teams must be informed and aligned about the possible impacts on roles, skills, and business processes before, during, and after technology deployment. The case study starts with an examination of some of the historical factors that have limited rapid, global adoption of new technologies in BP. It describes the unique aspects of the overall business transformation project design and timeline, and some of the key work products required to establish both the case for change and business case. Finally, it presents some of the dimensions of business value that can be associated with the use of intelligent well information. Looking forward, the paper describes some of the remaining challenges and opportunities dealing with scale up, acceleration, and centralized business process governance.

      "Title": "Scheduling and dynamic relocation for IEEE 802.11s mesh deterministic access",
      "Abstract": "Deployment of Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) is becoming increasingly popular due to the low-impact and low-cost features of wireless devices. This is especially true for WMNs based on IEEE 802.11 which, however, does not include native support for multi-hop relaying. This gap is being filled by the Task Group 's' of the IEEE 802.11 which has recently published an amendment in order to add mesh functions to the popular standard IEEE 802.11. Among the enhancements proposed, Mesh Deterministic Access (MDA) allows mesh routers to negotiate periodic collision-free transmission opportunities, called MDAOPs, to the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer on a hop-by-hop manner. Control messages are exchanged to advertise the reserved MDAOPs in the two-hop neighborhood. MDA lays the foundations for enabling QoS provisioning functions in IEEE 802.11s WMNs, such as end-to-end bandwidth reservation, call admission control, and traffic engineering. In this paper we study the problem of scheduling MDAOPs, which is left unspecified by the standard, and propose two baseline algorithms. Furthermore, we provide evidence that performance under MDA can be significantly degraded by the unknown interference of traffic flows outside the two-hop neighborhood. A dynamic relocation procedure is proposed in order to combat this phenomenon, thus providing traffic flows established in the WMN with stable performance. This procedure does not need any modifications to the standard MDA procedure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that tackles this problem in the context of IEEE 802.11s. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is evaluated by means of a packet-level simulation. © IEEE.",

The refractive index of the active layers was taken from ellipsometry measurements, the optical constants of PEDOT:PSS and the metal layers were taken from the data. The Cr and Cu anode contacts were deposited on thoroughly cleaned glass substrates by thermal evaporation through a fine shadow mask.

      "Title": "SensorGrid architecture for distributed event classification",
      "Abstract": "Recent advances in electronic circuit miniaturisation and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) have led to the creation of small sensor nodes which integrate several kinds of sensors, a central processing unit (CPU), memory and a wireless transceiver. A collection of these sensor nodes forms a sensor network which is easily deployable to provide a high degree of visibility into real-world physical processes as they happen, thus benefiting a variety of applications such as environmental monitoring, surveillance and target tracking. Some of these sensor nodes may also incorporate actuators such as buzzers and switches which can affect the environment directly. We shall simply use the generic term sensor node to refer to these sensor-actuator nodes as well. A parallel development in the technology landscape is grid computing, which is essentially the federation of heterogeneous computational servers connected by high-speed network connections. Middleware technologies such as Globus (2006) and Gridbus (2005) enable secure and convenient sharing of resources such as CPU, memory, storage, content and databases by users and applications. This has caused grid computing to be referred to as computing on tap, utility computing and IBMs mantra, on demand computing. Many countries have recognised the importance of grid computing for eScience and the grid has a number of success stories from the fields of bioinformatics, drug design, engineering design, business, manufacturing, and logistics. There is some existing work on the intersecting fields of sensor networks and grid computing which can be broadly grouped into three categories: (1) sensorwebs, (2) sensors to grid, and (3) sensor networks to grid. In the first category of sensorwebs, many different kinds of sensors are connected together through middleware to enable timely and secure access to sensor readings. Examples are the SensorNet effort by the Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL) and NIST (USA) which aims to collect sensor data from different places to facilitate the operations of the emergency services; the IrisNet effort by Intel to create the seeing Internet by enabling data collection and storage, and the support of rich queries over the Internet; and the Department of Defense (USA) ForceNet which integrates many kinds of sensor data to support air, sea and land military operations. In the second category of sensors to grid, the aim is to connect sensors and instruments to the grid to facilitate collaborative scientific research and visualisation (Chiu and Frey 2005). Examples are the efforts by the Internet2 and eScience communities in areas such as the collaborative design of aircraft engines and environment monitoring; DiscoveryNet (Imperial College UK) which aims to perform knowledge discovery and air pollution monitoring; and the earthquake science efforts by the CrisisGrid team (Indiana University USA) and iSERVO (International Solid Earth Research Virtual Observatory). Finally, in the third category of sensor networks to grid, the aim is mainly to use grid web services to integrate sensor networks and enable queries on live data. Examples are efforts by Gaynor et al (2004) to facilitate quicker medical response and supply chain management; and the SPRING framework proposed by Lim et al (2005). Our focus and approach, which we refer to as sensor-grid computing executing on an integrated sensor-grid architecture or simply SensorGrid for short (Tham and Buyya 2005), see Fig. 5.1 builds on the three categories of existing work described above and aims to achieve more by exploiting the complementary strengths and characteristics of sensor networks and grid computing. Sensor-grid computing combines the real-time acquisition and processing of data about the environment by sensor networks with intensive distributed computations on the grid. This enables the construction of real-time models and databases of the environment and physical processes as they unfold, from which high-value computations such as analytics, data mining, decision-making, optimisation and prediction can be carried out to generate on-the-fly results. This powerful combination would enable, for example, effective early warning of threats (such as missiles) and natural disasters, and real-time business process optimisation. One other key aspect of sensor-grid computing is the emphasis on distributed and hierarchical in-network processing at several levels of the SensorGrid architecture. As will be explained later, the sensor-grid computing approach is more robust and scalable compared to other approaches in which computations are mainly performed on the grid itself. The sensor-grid computing approach together with the SensorGrid architecture enable more timely responses to be achieved and useful results to be available even in the presence of failures in some parts of the architecture. The organisation of this chapter is as follows. In Section 2, we describe a simple centralised approach to realise sensor-grid computing. We then point out its weaknesses and propose a distributed approach. In Section 3, we describe two applications of distributed sensor-grid computing which we have implemented. In Section 4, several challenges and research issues related to sensorgrid computing are discussed. Finally, we conclude in Section 5. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.",

      "Title": "Canadian partnerships in upcoming Mars exploration missions",
      "Abstract": "Canada is a partner in the next three international Mars missions: the NASA Phoenix and Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), and the ESA ExoMars. The Phoenix Mars Lander was launched on 4 August 2007. Canada's contribution ' to Phoenix is the Meteorological (MET) package, which consists of a lidar and sensors for measuring pressure and temperature. MSL is a NASA rover scheduled for launch in 2009. A key instrument on MSL is the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS), which was competitively selected by NASA as a Canadian contribution. APXS determines the elemental composition of surface materials. Phoenix and MSL will be followed by the ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2013. In preparation for Canadian participation in the international surface exploration of the Moon and Mars, including future phases of the ESA ExoMars mission, a number of technology developments were undertaken at MDA including the development of a Rover Chassis Prototype (RCP), a Rover Chassis Analysis and Simulation Tool (RCAST) and techniques for autonomous visual motion estimation and terrain modelling. This paper summarizes the current status of Phoenix MET, MSL APXS and ExoMars rover technology development at MDA, provides details about the relevant technologies and describes Canada's contribution to these international missions.

      "Title": "Service brokers for wireless sensor networks",
      "Abstract": "Readers and conference attendees will learn about the current problems with system-wide implementation related to the emerging field of wireless sensor networks and the possible solution set consisting of a common set of foundational software. Readers and conference attendees will examine a particular example from the wireless sensor network field that illustrates the problems for a programmer trying to implement a system-wide application on top of a network of 100 to 10,000 wireless sensor/control nodes. Current state of the art consists of the programmer programming each node individually, constructing their own datagram, event, rule, data aggregation, and data processing algorithms. This current situation, while bearing initial prototype fruit, is untenable for most implementers of wireless sensor networks because the software necessary to get a complete application up and running is difficult to write, takes several man years and defocuses the implementing organization from the business process logic required for the specific applications. This paper discusses the concept a \"Service Broker\" - a set of common foundational software services needed to interface with devices, abstract datagrams into meaningful information via message types, translate messages into meaningful data values in a data representation of the system (as opposed to a device-centric representation) - to remove the burden currently placed on an application developer by isolating the wireless network communication from solutions.

The adoption of transponders in the field of automobile logistics is currently confined to few applications in closed circuits. The main reasons are relatively high costs as well as insufficient standardisation and performance of RFID-systems. The authors have investigated possible fields of transponder usage in an idealised automobile terminal of E.H.Harms Automobile-Logistics starting with the presentation of improvement opportunities for the existing business processes. Consequently basic options of utilizing transponders in this specific industry are described and compared in the context of a costbenefit analysis.",

      "Title": "3D localization in large-scale Wireless Sensor Networks: A micro-differential evolution approach",
      "Abstract": "Most of the recent proposed approaches for sen-sor(mote) localization are focused on 2-D environments with limited functionalities. This is mostly due to the nature of problem which is non-linear, large-scale, and has limited hardware resources. The micro-evolutionary algorithms (MEAs) utilize a small-size population to solve optimization problems. Therefore, such algorithms require much less processing time and memory than standard evolutionary algorithms (EA), suitable for implementation on embedded systems. In this paper, a novel protocol for localization of motes in 3-D environments is proposed, simulated, and discussed. The localization problem is modeled as an optimization problem. The proposed model is based on a realistic approach to the localization problem, where possible errors and noises in the localization procedure such as signal strength detection are addressed. To present a suitable approach to solve the proposed optimization model, a comparative study on performance of the micro-differential evolution (MDE) algorithms is performed and the results are discussed. © 2014 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "Recent advancements in technologies have revolutionized our world. New visions and approaches are being presented for the integration of the physical world with the cyber world. New and smarter systems for daily life utilities are being introduced and existing systems are being transformed towards smarter, efficient and more reliable systems. This paper is based on the same phenomenon. We propose a dynamic and efficient street lights operation strategy in the form of a smart street lighting system. The proposed design is based on collaborative sensing of motion and decision making in terms of the direction of motion and light intensity control. Business process modeling provides the illustration of each process in detail and provides the basis for the smart street light system implementation as part of a larger internet of things project. © Research India Publications.",

      "Title": "Business Process Modeling for developing performance measurement system using Internet of Things (IoT)",
      "Abstract": "The concept of Internet of Things (IoT) is important in collecting the shop floor data and transmitting it into the Information System in real time. The rapid proliferation of IoT in recent days has given rise to demands for clear definition among metrics as important sources of the performance measurement. This requirement comes from the various usage of IoT data: One raw IoT data is able to produce many metrics. In order to understand it, we need to consider the usage points of IoT data at different management levels. And by composing company management levels: Strategic level, Tactical level and operational levels, we are able to analysis usage of IoT data among management levels. The purpose of this study is to present the work flow of the performance measurement process with regard to monitoring the IoT outcomes. Also, we try to explore the core issues with Business Process Modelling and simulation. As a result of study, we expect that how IoT data is processed and which level needs an IoT data as a performance metrics. We use BPM as a description of activities that constitute a performance measurement. Those are described in a graphical way using some components: Agent, Resources, Process, flow logic, and etc. Agent is management level which is consists of following three level: Strategic level, Tactical level and operational levels. Resources is defined as \"IoT outcomes that is of utility and under the control of some agents?. Process has an acitivity that uses the resources to produce new or modify existing process. The identification and discussion of result of BPM reflects how IoT data is handled and make a clear distinction of metrics usage among management levels.",

      "Abstract": "Services of Internet providing companies are in-demand nowadays when each commercial or residential site needs to have broadband Internet access. Every new customer for the Internet providing company is a new project which requires certain techniques to be managed properly. Plugging a new customer into broadband is a cross-functional challenge and the more effective the project management team is, the more effective would be the whole project. The paper describes the approach to project management team structure (according to PRINCE2 project management standard) for Internet providing companies. The project management team structure proposed in the paper takes into account the traditional organizational structure of telecommunication companies, follows its hierarchy and helps to implement the project management standard into existing business-processes. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",

Dimensions typically measured are quality, time and cost. In the process of best practice benchmarking, management identifies the best firms in their industry, or in another industry where similar processes exist, and compares the results and processes of those studied to one’s own results and processes. In this way, they learn how well the targets perform and, more importantly, the business processes that explain why these firms are successful. Article defines assess performance indicators of production processes in relation to attractiveness industry, their meaning and mission. The practical part is focused on the evaluation of selected indicators of sectoral environment in manufacturing in subclassifications of object manufacturing activities called Manufacture of other machine.

      "Title": "The Shifting Printing Paradigm: A goodbye to traditional printing technology",
      "Abstract": "The initial expansion enabled by mash-ups and the fusion of distinct technologies in the core compute area of information technology (IT) have spread to all areas of IT services and are now moving into business process management. This fusion of technologies is now proliferating new products and services, which cover a much larger set of customer needs (Figure 1). As a result, the traditional IT deployment has been replaced with cloud and mobile devices, providing alternatives to server and personal computer (PC) operating configurations. These new deployment models not only provide new market capabilities and services but often result in lower operation costs (Figure 2). The changes in the hardcopy market follow these same technology shifts. This fundamental shift in IT technologies demands a similar shift in printing. Today's leading print services now integrate cloud technology, mobility, and support standards in the Internet of Things (IoT).

In this paper, we try to develop an algorithm that is able to efficiently compute the closeness centrality analysis equation suggested from the conventional social network analysis literature, and eventually the developed algorithm will be applied to analyzing the degree of work-intimacy among those workflow-actors who are allocated to perform the corresponding workflow model.

The based idea of the method is that the problem of nonlinear system identification is changed into optimization problems in parameter space. In order to enhance the performance of the DE identification, put forward a kind of adaptive mutation differential evolution algorithm for scaling factor (MDE), and on this basis, we make an improvement on crossover to make a better performance. To make an analysis for particle swarm optimization (PSO), DE and improved DE, the improvement DE has higher accurate and recognition ability, stronger convergence.

      "Title": "Improved decoding algorithm of serial belief propagation with a stop updating criterion for ldpc codes and applications in patterned media storage",
      "Abstract": "In high density patterned media storage system, the 'multiple islands per read head' model is taken into account for inter-track interference (ITI) in bit-patterned media (BPM). It has been proposed that low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes could improve the symbol error rate (SER) performance significantly when only considering AWGN noise alone over the storage channel. LDPC decoding algorithm could be applied in LDPC joint decoder of patterned media storage system. In this paper, we proposed a decoding algorithm of serial belief propagation (SBP) with a stop updating criterion for LDPC decoder. Simulation results show that the proposed decoding algorithm could reduce the times of generating and propagating the message in decoding with negligible error rate performance loss over AWGN channels when appropriately choosing the parameter that determines which variable node has been converged. By taking advantage of extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts, it is demonstrated that the proposed decoding algorithm could maintain superior SER performance and convergence rate compared with the traditional SBP decoding algorithm. To further explore the performance of the proposed decoding algorithm in 'multiple islands per read head' model, we performed a large number of simulations over this channel model with different distribution percentages between the AWGN and the island position jitter noise. Simulation results show that the LDPC codes could improve the SER performance when considering jitter noise while the proposed decoding algorithm behaves excellently over the patterned media storage channel and over the AWGN channel.

      "Title": "A software design approach for heterogeneous systems of unattended sensors, unmanned vehicles and monitoring stations",
      "Abstract": "The design and implementation of software for network systems of diverse physical assets is a continuing challenge to sensor network developers. The problems are often multiplied when adding new elements, and when reconfiguring existing systems. For software systems, like physical systems, explicit architectural descriptions increase system level comprehension. Coupled with well defined object oriented design practices, system extensibility is defined and software reuse and code composition are enabled. Our research is based on model driven design architecture. High level system models are defined in the Unified Modeling Language (UML), the language of the software engineer. However, since most experimental work is done by non-software specialists, (electronics Engineers, Mechanical Engineers and technicians) the model is translated into a graphical, domain specific model. Components are presented as domain specific icons, and constraints from the UML model are propagated into the domain model. Domain specialists manipulate the domain model, which then composes software elements needed at each node to create an aggregate system.",

      "Abstract": "To solve the problems of data processing layer such as high-throughput real-time stream data processing, data transfer protocol, massive data storage and elastic computing, a real-time stream data processing framework based on Internet of Things (IoT) was proposed. By using model driven and modular software design approaches, the framework was divided into data layer, runtime layer, model layer, instrument layer, application layer and other assistant modules. The runtime layer monitored the framework processes stream data with pipeline computing technology; the model layer customized data process procedures and data transfer protocols by defining process unit, topology model and protocol model; the data layer applied free tables of unstructured database to store massive data of device conditions. The application of condition monitoring for construction machinery showed the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

      "Title": "Survey for Sensor-Cloud System from Business Process Outsourcing Perspective",
      "Abstract": "Cloud computing is a new IT trend to meet the new business requirements such as business agility and operational efficiency with business process outsourcing (BPO). Sensor-Cloud infrastructure is the extended form of cloud computing to manage the sensors which are scattered throughout the network. Several benefits of adopting cloud computing including cost saving, high scalability, and business risk reductions also can be applied to sensor data collection. As a first investment for new technology, we analyze IT managers’ feedbacks to identify the most important factors of decision making for cloud platform adoption and IT outsourcing. Even though the technological motivation is persuasive in Korean IT market, survey results show that the cost efficiency is the most important for cloud platform adoption. Also surveys reveal that IT service consumers have difficulties understanding complicated service contracts and data sharing issues with infrastructure providers, which serve as main blockers of adopting cloud computing.",
