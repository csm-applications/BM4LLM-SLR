Exceptions can be made for well-known books on the subject.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n- EC1: Studies that do not contribute any specification technique for DO specifications, which includes DMs, DSLs, domain-based specifications, and DO integration specifications. For example, we exclude studies in which specifications, like requirements or DSL definitions, are only used as an example, while they do not explain how to make them.\n- EC2: Studies that focus on techniques for testing, reviewing, or checking specifications. We are looking for techniques in the context of system development, i.e., the creation and maintenance of domain-oriented specifications.\n- EC3: Studies that focus on techniques for human behavior or on how to organize the specification process. For example, SCRUM prescribes the specification of all work items, but it does not address how to specify them or how to apply them correctly.\n- EC4: Secondary and tertiary studies (e.g., systematic literature reviews, surveys, etc.). It is important to note that, though secondary studies are excluded, we may use them for precisely scoping the contribution of this SLR and for checking the completeness of the set of selected primary studies.\n- EC5: Studies that describe an approach for creating a DS and that do not comply with our notion of DM as explained in Section 2.1. As such we exclude studies that consider a domain as a set of systems or applications. We are interested in studies that see a domain specification as a language, and not as a framework to specify applications and systems. Of course, we will include a study if parts of it offer specification techniques that do comply with our notion of DM.\n- EC6: Studies that mainly focus on implementing DSs in a target environment without using an explicit DS of that environment. Transformation specifications from a source DS to a target DS are in scope. But transformations from a source domain to program code, without an explicit DS of the targeted software environment, are excluded.\n",

Several studies suggest using metamodeling techniques for modeling domains and their constraints. However, these techniques use different notions, and sometimes even different notations, for defining domains and their constraints and for specifying and designing the domain-specific applications. We propose an Application-based DOmain Modeling (ADOM) approach in which domains are treated as regular applications that need to be modeled before systems of those domains are specified and designed. This way, the domain models enforce static and dynamic constraints on their application models. The ADOM approach consists of threelayers and defines dependency and enforcement relations between these layers.

Previous approaches to feature modeling, such as FODA, use a single model with a particular semantics (AND/OR linkages, constraints) and a specific feature typology. ODM V2 utilizes a multi-modeling approach based on Sigma, a mathematical formalism (developed at Synquiry) for reasoning about how multiple abstractions of sets of instances interrelate and combine to give a unified understanding of a subject. Sigma defines a number of semantic relationships that can hold between separate conceptual models linked into a larger `model web'. One of these inter-model relationships captures the needed semantics for a flexible and general notion of `features' within a domain modeling context. The paper describes previous approaches to feature modeling in domain engineering, ODM's goals of general applicability which created requirements for a different approach, and key elements of the Sigma approach and its application to domain concept and feature modeling.",

      "Abstract": "Mostly the development of domain specific modeling languages (DSML) follows the traditional model driven engineering practices. First the syntax and semantics of the language are defined (at meta-level) and then it is used for the development of user models. In certain situations, it is hard even to conceptualize the demands of the user, let alone the definition of the language. Agile methods for software development suggest that the development activities should be performed alongside a client stakeholder for incremental development of the system. This approach helps in the elicitation of requirements in parallel to the actual development of the system. We followed this approach for developing a domain specific modeling language and its tooling for a local government project, Brest Métropole. The project aimed at filling the communication gap between the elected representatives (politicians) and the bureaucracy (government offcers). We used a modeling methodology that does not restrict a modeler's interaction to a single abstraction level. Thus a modeler can develop both models and metamodels at the same time, where the definition of one helps in defining the other. In this article, we explain our experiences from this project and share the lessons learnt.",

The definition of the precise semantics of domain-specific models is an important problem because semantics are a necessity to develop tools allowing formal analysis and verification. Current approaches focus on specific formalisms or languages which are the most appropriate to reason about certain properties.

      "Abstract": "© 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.When developing domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs), software engineers have to make a number of important design decisions on the DSML itself, or on the software-development process that is applied to develop the DSML. Thus, making well-informed design decisions is a critical factor in developing DSMLs. To support this decision-making process, the model-driven development community has started to collect established design practices in terms of patterns, guidelines, story-telling, and procedural models. However, most of these documentation practices do not capture the details necessary to reuse the rationale behind these decisions in other DSML projects. In this paper, we report on a three-year research effort to compile and to empirically validate a catalog of structured decision descriptions (decision records) for UML-based DSMLs. This catalog is based on design decisions extracted from 90 DSML projects. These projects were identified - among others - via an extensive systematic literature review (SLR) for the years 2005-2012. Based on more than 8,000 candidate publications, we finally selected 84 publications for extracting design-decision data. The extracted data were evaluated quantitatively using a frequent-item-set analysis to obtain characteristic combinations of design decisions and qualitatively to document recurring documentation issues for UML-based DSMLs. We revised the collected decision records based on this evidence and made the decision-record catalog for developing UML-based DSMLs publicly available. Furthermore, our study offers insights into UML usage (e.g. diagram types) and into the adoption of UML extension techniques (e.g. metamodel extensions, profiles).",

      "Abstract": "© 2016 ACM.Domain modeling is an important step in the transition from natural-language requirements to precise specifications. For large systems, building a domain model manually is a laborious task. Several approaches exist to assist engineers with this task, whereby candidate domain model elements are automatically extracted using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Despite the existing work on domain model extraction, important facets remain under-explored: (1) there is limited empirical evidence about the usefulness of existing extraction rules (heuristics) when applied in industrial settings; (2) existing extraction rules do not adequately exploit the natural-language dependencies detected by modern NLP technologies; and (3) an important class of rules developed by the information retrieval community for information extraction remains unutilized for building domain models. Motivated by addressing the above limitations, we develop a domain model extractor by bringing together existing extraction rules in the software engineering literature, extending these rules with complementary rules from the information retrieval literature, and proposing new rules to better exploit results obtained from modern NLP dependency parsers. We apply our model extractor to four industrial requirements documents, reporting on the frequency of different extraction rules being applied. We conduct an expert study over one of these documents, investigating the accuracy and overall effectiveness of our domain model extractor.",

      "Abstract": "Defining complex system dynamics (SD) models in complex organizational settings is hard. This is so because the numbers of variables to consider are many and the question of causation is complicated to untangle. Second, SD models are ambiguous and hard to conceptualize. In this paper, we explore the use of a domain modeling method object-role modeling (ORM) in the process of developing SD models. We do so, because domain modeling methods help to identify relationships among entities within the scope of the problem domain and provide a structural view of the domain. The addition of a domain modeling method to the process of developing SD models is to improve SD model conceptualization, enable transformation and reuse of information plus underpin SD with a domain modeling method that allows creation of database. To realize this, we come up with a procedure in our overall research which we refer to as grounded system dynamics (GSD) a combination of ORM and SD. To reason about the combination of SD with a domain modeling method (ORM), we identify and evaluate relationships between their constructs. Basing on the identified relations, ORM to stock and flow diagram (SFD) steps are defined and applied to a real-life case study national medical stores (NMS) situated in Uganda.

Domain analysis should consider commonalities and differences of systems in a domain, organize an understanding of the relationships between the various elements in that domain, and represent this understanding in a formal, yet easy to use, way. Several studies suggest using metamodeling techniques for modeling domains and their constraints. These metamodels are basically structural and present static constraints only. We propose an Application-based DOmain Modeling (ADOM) approach for domain analysis. This approach treats a domain as a regular application that needs to be modeled before systems of that domain are specified and designed. This way, the domain structure and behavior are modeled, enforcing static and dynamic constraints on the relevant application models. The ADOM approach consists of three-layers: the language layer handles modeling language ontologies and their constraints, the domain layer holds the building elements of domains and the relations among them, and the application layer consists of domain-specific systems. Furthermore, the ADOM approach defines dependency and enforcement relations between these layers. In this paper we focus on applying the ADOM approach to UML and especially to its class and sequence diagrams. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",

However, method engineers should be able to build process metamodels according to the specific organization needs. We propose a method to build unified, fitted and multi-viewpoints process meta-models. The process engineering method is based on a process domain model and on patterns.",

Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) have been increasingly gaining attention because they are developed to cope with particularities of specific domains. However, DSL development consists in a set of tasks to be performed and some can be error-prone. Identifying the correct set of elements within a DSL and their constraints can be very demanding. Alloy is a popular lightweight intuitive formal language with a simple notation that is easy to read and write. When models of a DSL are specified using Alloy, it becomes possible to generate instances that should represent valid models. So, this paper presents a generic innovative methodology using Alloy in DSL engineering, in order to find and tune language constraints in a systematic way. It also presents an empirical study illustrating the applicability of the proposed methodology.",

The development cost of a DSL should be modest compared to the cost of developing a general-purpose programming language. Reducing the implementation effort and providing reuse techniques are key aspects for DSL approaches to be really effective. In this paper, we present an approach to build embedded domain-specific languages applying the principles of model-driven engineering. On the basis of this approach, we will tackle reuse of DSLs by defining families of DSLs, addressing reuse both from the DSL developer and user point of views. A family of DSLs will be built up by composing several DSLs, so we will propose composition mechanisms for the abstract syntax, concrete syntax, and model transformation levels of a DSL's definition. Finally, we contribute a software framework to support our approach, and we illustrate the paper with a case study to demonstrate its practical applicability. © 2009 IEEE.",

One solution is to compose existing DSMLs to form a new more complete DSML. Based on a metamodels composition we can improve the process of rapid prototyping of new DSMLs. In this paper we investigate the consequences of composing metamodels of DSMLs on their graphical syntaxes. Our motivation is to upgrade the quick development of graphical editors for a new DSML formed by the composition of multiple DSMLs metamodels. We explain how the DSMLs can be reused to rapidly form new ones with low cost. Thus, this work contributes by defining a set of rules to compose DSMLs and provide a layer for DSMLs graphical syntaxes composition. We propose three rules to compose DSMLs metamodels: reference, specialization and fusion. We have used a small use case to illustrate the approach. For each defined rule we apply it to the use case to exemplify it. We expose, throughout these examples, how graphical syntaxes can be reused. We also show on how graphical editors can be composed.",

DSMLs offer a vocabulary of terms and concepts that are fundamental to the problem and solution domains, whereas GPMLs constructs are usually too generic to be directly applied in some domains. Many DSMLs are high-level textual programming languages, which offered little support for modeling at the analysis, and design phases of application development. The objective of this work is to develop semi-formal graphical DSMLs, which are to be used at the analysis and design stages of application development.

Therefore, putting efficiently Model-Driven Engineering into practice involves designing specific modeling languages. The goal is to cover in a more suitable manner a particular application domain (e.g. automotive) or specific concerns (e.g. hardware modeling) or even to focus on a given class of practitioners. In this respect, two design approaches are generally opposed which respectively propose to define domain-specific modeling languages from scratch or to customize an existing general-purpose language. This paper focuses on the latter approach and claims that UML profiles do provide handy and powerful mechanisms to design domain-specific modeling languages but are penalized by lacks of methodological guidelines and tool support. To cope with these lacks, a profile design approach is introduced, which includes a methodological framework to structure profiles design process and tool support to partly automate this process. © 2009 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "© 2015 IEEE.The core process a modeling method engineer needs to accomplish starts with the acquisition of domain knowledge and requirements, and ends with the deployment of a usable modeling tool. In between, a key intermediate deliverable of this process is the modeling method specification which, ideally, should be platform independent. On one hand, it takes input from a structured understanding of the application domain and scenarios; on the other hand, it provides sufficiently structured input to support the implementation of tool support for modeling activities. It is quite common that such modeling methods are domain-specific, in the sense that they provide concepts from the domain as 'first-class modeling citizens'. However, for the purposes of this paper, we raise the level of abstraction for 'domain specificity' and consider 'modeling method engineering' as the application domain. Consequently, we raise several research questions - whether a domain-specific language can support this domain, and what would be its requirements, properties, constructs and grammar. We propose an initial draft of such a language - one that abstracts away from meta-modeling platforms by establishing a meta2 layer of abstraction where a modeling method can be defined in a declarative manner, then the final modeling tool is generated by automated compilation of the method definition for the meta-modeling environment of choice.",

An important tool for this purpose is reference models, whose aim is to capture domain knowledge and assist in the design of enterprise specific business processes. However, while much attention has been given to the content of these models, the actual process of reusing this knowledge has not been extensively addressed. In order to address this lack, we propose to utilize a domain engineering approach, called Application based Domain Modeling (ADOM), for the purpose of specifying and applying reference models. We demonstrate the approach by specifying a sell process reference model and instantiating it for a chocolate manufacturer. The benefits of utilizing the ADOM approach for specifying business models are the provisioning of validation templates by the reference models and the ability to apply the approach to various modeling languages and business process views.",

The method provides a good paradigm for automating software development that has flexibility, reusability, agility and productivity across the software life cycle. It can rapidly generate a new domain application without code programming when requirements changing. So the method can generate a domain software family, not only a single application.

      "Abstract": "An Adaptive Object Model (AOM) is a common architectural style for systems in which classes, attributes, relationships and behaviors of applications are represented as metadata consumed at runtime. This allows them to be very flexible and changeable at runtime, enabling their modification by end users without source code modification. Nevertheless, this flexibility comes with a cost of a greater complexity when developing the system, and therefore one usually uses a bottom-up approach, adding flexibility only when it is needed. As a consequence, many AOM components are tied to the specific domain of a single application and this fact makes it difficult to develop and use generic and reusable AOM frameworks that properly handle specific requirements of the AOM architecture. This work presents an architectural model that aims to adapt domain-specific AOM core structures to a common core structure by identifying AOM roles played by each element through custom metadata configuration. By doing this, this model allows the integration of domain-specific AOM applications and AOM frameworks, making it feasible to develop reusable components for the AOM architecture. This model is evaluated by creating an AOM framework and a case study based on it, in which is performed a modularity and a performance analysis. © J.UCS.",

Techniques for implementing DSLs also lack interoperable capabilities among base languages and limited tool support. Such challenges result in increasing DSL development cost and constrain DSL adoption opportunities. This paper introduces a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach to address such problems. The approach utilizes WSDL to perform lexical and syntax analysis. Web services are used to define the semantics of a DSL, and WS-BPEL is then used to specify a DSL program. We present two case studies representing different DSL categories to show the feasibility of SOA-based DSL implementation. The case studies demonstrate the potential for easing the burden of DSL evolution and offering interoperability and tool support. Improved modularization and removal of tokenization/parsing are two additional advantages. Discussion and comparison among interpreter-based, model-driven and SOA-based DSL implementations are provided, which may raise more research interests in this area. © 2010 IEEE.",

This paper introduces how to develop DSLs using the conceptbased development method. The development processes of DSLs using it can be divided into two phases: the first phase is to define and specify concepts which are basic units of DSLs; the second phase is to assemble DSLs with the concepts. The two phases are independent; therefore, a DSL can be implemented by domain experts and language experts together. on the basis of this idea, a metalanguage, DD, is defined for specifying DSLs. Each concept is defined as an independent module, which can help to improve the reusability of the DSLs developments. The concepts of the DSLs are divided into two kinds: element concepts and complement concepts, which makes the definitions of DSLs more flexible. In addition, attribute grammars and evolving algebras are used to specify the semantics of DSLs, which makes the specifications intuitive.",

      "Abstract": "The Unified Modeling Language is widely used as a design tool for modeling a software system via a set of diagrams providing both static and dynamic views of the system. However, the applications of UML have many problems, namely model inconsistent behaviors, model misconception, and mistake interpretation. The notations are used in different definitions that may not conform to the UML specification. This paper thus present a semantic approach to verifying UML activity diagrams with a domain specific language called Action Description Language (ADL). The method would facilitate the inspection of activity diagrams for the conformance to UML specification, resulting in better quality of design blueprints that would lead to quality software systems. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",

      "Abstract": "Majority of the systems developed in the field of education aim to tailor information presented to their users according to them as efficiently as possible. Often these systems use a User Model, a Domain Model and an Interaction Model to provide the adaptation/personalization effect. However, any deficiencies in these models directly influence the quality of adaptation the system provides. In order to address this issue, we propose to use modeled user's interaction traces to detect these deficiencies in the domain model. Furthermore, the use of these interaction traces will help us in proposing a more correct domain model according to the user's competence. We had tested our approach by creating an educational system. The overlay modeling approach is used with Bayesian Networks to model our domain model. The results of the conducted experiments are also presented in this article.",

      "Abstract": "Context: Dependency management often suffers from labor intensity and complexity in creating and maintaining the dependency relations in practice. This is even more critical in a distributed development, in which developers are geographically distributed and a wide variety of tools is used. In those settings, different interpretations of software requirements or usage of different terminologies make it challenging to predict the change impact. Objective: is (a) to describe a method facilitating change management in geographically distributed software engineering by effective discovery and establishment of dependency links using domain models; (b) to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Method: A domain model, providing a common reference point, is used to manage development objects and to automatically support dependency discovery. We propose to associate (annotate) development objects with the concepts from the model. These associations are used to compute dependency among development objects, and are stepwise refined to direct dependency links (i.e. enabling product traceability). To evaluate the method, we conducted a laboratory-based randomized experiment on two real cases. Six participants were using an implemented prototype and two comparable tools to perform simulated tasks. Results: In the paper we elaborate on the proposed method discussing its functional steps. Results from the experiment show that the method can be effectively used to assist in discovery of dependency links. Users have discovered on average fourteen percent more dependency links than by using the comparable tools. Conclusions: The proposed method advocates the use of domain models throughout the whole development life-cycle and is apt to facilitate multi-site software engineering. The experimental study and results suggest that the method is effective in the discovery of dependencies among development objects. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

We develop these ideas in the context of industrial computing systems by presenting a semantics and proof system for a language based on IEC 1131-3, the international standard programming language for programmable controllers. Of particular significance in this example is the use of a diagrammatic representation and the development of a proof system for a class of invariance properties that requires only local knowledge of the structure of diagrams.",

We present a (constraint) logic programming-based framework for specification, efficient implementation, and automatic verification of domain specific languages (DSLs). Our framework is based on using Horn logic (or pure Prolog), and eventually constraints, to specify denotational semantics of domain specific languages. Both the syntax as well as the semantic specification of the DSL in question are directly executable in our framework: the specification itself serves as an interpreter for the DSL. More efficient implementations of this DSL-a compiler-can be automatically derived via partial evaluation. Additionally, the executable specification can be used for automatic or semi-automatic verification of programs written in the DSL as well as for automatically obtaining traditional debuggers and profilers. The ability to verify DSL programs is a distinct advantage of our approach. In this paper we give a general outline of our approach, and illustrate it with practical examples. © 2002 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

All rights reserved.As modern distributed and cloud architecture keep gaining their popularity, web services have become the programmatic backbones of more and more systems. Developing web services requires gathering information from different aspects. Model-driven engineering promises to ease the burden of development and promote reuse of web services by focusing more on a higher level of abstraction. Current approach of modeling web services using UML is not well-suited since UML is created for multiple disciplines and is not specific for web service development. With current growing scale of distributed systems, the challenge is not only in development but also integration and maintenance of web services. Introducing a domain specific language (DSL) for modeling of web services promises to become a novel approach and could be the solution to the current problem with web service modeling and development. This article outlines the analysis as well as the current state of the problem domain and introduces an approach to model-driven development of web services by implementing a domain specific language called SWSM (Simple Web Service Modeling). This approach aims to solve problems that UML could not effectively resolve and promote efficiency with a non-complex language facility for modeling and code generation of web services.

      "Abstract": "A domain model describes common and variant requirements for a system family. UML notations used in requirements analysis and software modeling can be extended with \"variation points\" to cater for variant requirements. However, UML models for a large single system are already complicated enough. With variants - UML domain models soon become too complicated to be useful. The main reasons are the explosion of possible variant combinations, complex dependencies among variants and inability to trace variants from a domain model down to the requirements for a specific system, member of a family. We believe that the above mentioned problems cannot be solved at the domain model description level alone. In the paper, we propose a novel solution based on a tool that interprets and manipulates domain models to provide analysts with customized, simple domain views. We describe a variant configuration language that allows us to instrument domain models with variation points and record variant dependencies. An interpreter of this language produces customized views of a domain model, helping analysts understand and reuse software models.

The modified telegrapher's equations (MTE) are used to describe a thin wire antenna, and a rather fine grid is required at the feed point for accurate input impedance calculation. In that case, eliminating the Courant-Friedrich-Lewy (CFL) limit is important to speed up the calculation. By expressing transient behaviors of field, current, and voltage using global WLP temporal bases, a marching-on-in-degree scheme is obtained through the orthogonality of WLP bases. Without the CFL stability condition, the proposed method is more efficient than conditionally stable finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, which requires a large number of time-steps for computing the solution when a very fine grid is used in the spatial mesh. Simulated results are presented and discussed to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. © 2009 IEEE.",

The main development activities are the construction of visual (typically Unified Modelling Language (UML)) models and the transformation of source models into target models, including application code generation. The use of visual models to produce application code often starts at the design (Platform Independent Model) level, and whereas business processes (Computation Independent Models (CIM)) have lately been considered, they are not used in MDA to either derive design models or application code. This paper enhances the MDA process by considering the early stages of software development that pertain to problem domain analysis. We argue that problem domain analysis and modelling can form valuable input to the more formal MDA phases at the CIM and PIM levels. We propose the use of a visual notation that allows informal modelling of domain-based concepts. Modelling at this stage using the proposed notation is geared to support involvement of non-technical business stakeholders whilst feeding into business process modelling at the CIM phase.",

Moreover, nowadays, for the development of computer systems, the Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) paradigm became popular as it advocates use of services to support the development of rapid, low-cost, interoperable, evolvable, and distributed applications. Being a system development paradigm, the SOC can provide fundamental building blocks for developing ubiquitous CA systems. However, context-awareness itself is a relatively new and scattered research area. Due to the complex challenges encountered in a development of CA systems (such as context acquisition or the multifaceted nature of context), current research initiatives address only some specific problems, abstracting from others. Nevertheless, a holistic view of context-awareness encompasses numerous relevant cross-cutting research and development aspects. This holistic view is presented by means of a domain model of context-awareness proposed in this chapter. We reveal state-of-the-art of the individual research (sub-) domains and we analyze how they fit in the proposed domain model and how they map onto the widely used layered model for C A systems development. SOC could be effectively used to develop services catering to each (sub-) domain and SOC fundamentals such as interoperability and service composition could be further exploited to develop a complete CA system.

For time discretization of the second-order time-derivative, two finite-difference schemes, i.e. backward difference and Newmark- <IT>ß</IT> techniques, are proposed. Findings - Both schemes are implicit and always stable and have unconditional stability with different orders of accuracy and numerical dispersion. The unconditional stability of the proposed methods is analytically proven and numerically verified.

The process and architecture in the case of the Cambodian malaria surveillance system were modeled using the engineering system multiple-domain matrix modeling framework. By using the attributes of the process, architecture, and the risk associated with the environment within the model, relative weights of the constituent systems were scored at each interval of time. The simulated confidence intervals of the absolute difference in the scores indicated that this approach yields the transformation of the system under investigation. By comparing the calculated scores with the results of the simulation test employing an agent-based modeling method, further insights into the process, the limitations, and advantages of the scoring approach were discussed. This approach provides the first step in analyzing the transitional conditions of constituent systems as well as the entire health information system, whereby informed decision making for optimizing continuous system management is facilitated.",

      "Abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) simulation of a linear induction launcher-type coil gun is performed by the cylindrical finite-difference time domain (FDTD) method. Maxwell's equations in cylindrical coordinates are used to formulate the problem. Circular symmetry is assumed for reducing the 3D problem to a 2D one. A singularity that appeared at r=0 is extracted by using the integral formulation of the FDTD method. A special quasi-static approximation of the FDTD method is applied in the cylindrical problem space which is terminated with the second-order Mur absorbing boundary condition. The armature movement in the FDTD method is treated by the quasi-steady-state method. An experimental model was built, and the muzzle velocity was measured for comparison with the calculated value. Good agreement was obtained. © 2011 © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",

      "Abstract": "Appliances represent a quickly growing domain that raises new challenges in OS design and development. First, new products appear at a rapid pace to satisfy emerging needs. Second, the nature of these markets makes these needs unpredictable. Lastly, given the competitiveness of such markets, there exists tremendous pressure to deliver new products. In fact, innovation is a requirement in emerging markets to gain commercial success. The embedded nature of appliances makes upgrading and fixing bugs difficult (and sometimes impossible) to achieve. Consequently, there must be a high level of confidence in the software. Additionally, the pace of innovation requires rapid OS development so as to match ever changing needs of new appliances. To offer confidence, software must be highly robust. That is, for a given type of appliance, critical behavioral properties must be determined and guaranteed (e.g., power management must ensure that data are not lost). Robustness can be provided by mechanisms and/or tools. The ideal approach takes the form of certification tools aimed at statically verifying critical properties. Such tools avoid the need for a laborious and error-prone testing process. To be first in a market requires not only that the testing process be shortened, but the development time as well. To achieve this goal, three strategies are needed: Re-use of code to rapidly produce a new product by assembling existing building blocks, factorization of expertise to capitalize on domain-specific experience, and open-endedness of software systems to match evolving functionalities and hardware features. In this paper, existing OS approaches are assessed with respect to the requirements raised by appliances. The limitations of these approaches are analyzed and used as a basis to propose a new approach to designing and structuring OSes for appliances. This approach is based on Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), and offers rapid development of robust OSes. We illustrate and assess our approach by concrete examples.",

All rights reserved.An adaptive software has the ability to modify its own behavior at runtime due to changes in the users and their context in the system, requirements, or environment in which the system is deployed, and thus, give the users a better experience. However, the development of this kind of systems is not a simple task. There are two main issues: (1) there is a lack of languages to specify, unambiguously, the elements related to the design phase. As a consequence, these systems are often developed in an ad-hoc manner, without the required formalism, augmenting the complexity in the process of derivation of design models to the next phases in the development cycle. (2) Design decisions and the adaptation model tend to be directly implemented into the source code and not thoroughly specified at the design level. Since the adaptation models become tangled with the code, system evolution becomes more difficult. To address the above issues, this paper proposes DMLAS, a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to design adaptive systems. As proof of concept, this paper also provides a functional prototype based on the Sirius plugin for Eclipse. This prototype is a tool to model, in several layers of abstraction, the main components of an adaptive system. The notation used both in the models and the tool was validated against the nine principles for designing cognitively effective visual notations presented by Moody.",

      "Abstract": "Requirements Engineering (RE) is the branch of Software Engineering dealing with requirements for software systems. A software requirement is a property which must be exhibited by software developed or adapted to solve a particular problem. Within RE, there are several branches of methodologies for obtaining requirements, among which we have Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE), that uses goals to treat requirements. The visual complexity of standard GORE diagrams, when dealing with real cases, can get very high due to the high number of goals to be refined and detailed in the models. This can make them unreadable and difficult to manage and, as a consequence, the models can became harder to validate or update. As this problem has never been tackled before by the current existent tools, this paper proposes an extension to the KAOS language in order to incorporate the notion of Compartment, an encapsulation technique to keep concepts and with collapsing ability at user's request, with the main purpose of improving scalability of models. For the making of the tool it was used the Eclipse framework (with GMF/EMF plugins). We have chosen a specific GORE methodology named KAOS and based on it we designed a new Domain-Specific Language (DSL) by creating its extended metamodel. © 2009 IEEE.",

However, AEM modelling has been ignoring the topographic effect. To understand the influence of topography on AEM, we develop in this paper a timedomain AEM modelling method based on unstructured finite-element method. First, Fourier transform is applied to Maxwell equations to transform the 2.5D problem to 2D. After obtaining the governing equations from the Maxwell equations, the Galerkin method is applied and we get the final discrete equations system for the solution of EM responses in frequency-domain. Via a cosine transform, we get the time-domain Airborne EM responses. The simulation results in this paper are compared with both the published results and the semi-analytical ones and proved that the algorithm presented in this paper has a high accuracy.",

Thus, the harmonic analysis of these loads is useful for the assessment of current distortion in low voltage distribution systems. However, an assessment considering the diversity and attenuation effects represents a challenge on harmonic modeling. This paper proposes a method (T2F DM) to transform SMP S Time Domain Models (T DM) into Frequency Domain Models (F DM) in order to estimate the input current waveforms when the amplitude, phase angle and distortion of the supply voltage varies (e.g., voltage regulation) around some operating point. The T2F DM provides the Admittance matrix, which is suitable to assess the impact of household loads with lower computational cost. The method is based on the use of Polarplots Fingerprints computed from T DMs and not from a large set of measurements. The results from T2F DM, F DM and T DM are compared against laboratory measurements via the computation of error performance metrics. The study shows that the methodology is appropriate to compute accurate and efficient F DMs from a T DM and a small set of measurements.",

Thus, there is a need for efficient modelling solutions. One possibility is to combine the established time-domain methods with more efficient methods. The aim of this paper has been to develop a time-domain model combining the equivalent source method (ESM) and the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The idea was to model the complex acoustic fields using FDTD method and the less complex fields using ESM. These methods were coupled by ensuring continuity of volume velocity and pressure at the boundary between them. Simulations with the combination of the methods were compared to analytical and experimental results, and shown to be accurate and numerically stable for 1-D energy flow, including viscous attenuation. Furthermore, the combination proved significantly quicker than using only the FDTD method.

      "Abstract": "Thermoacoustic devices are today mainly simulated using frequency-domain methods. Contrary to frequencydomain methods, time-domain methods may include non-linear effects and time-varying boundary conditions. However, time-domain modelling of thermoacoustic devices is computationally expensive, due to large differences in geometric length scales and time scales. The primary aim of this paper has been to model thermoacoustic devices with computational efficiency by using two different methods. The acoustic field outside the stack, based on the assumption of plane waves, is modelled using the efficient Equivalent Source Method (ESM), whereas the complex acoustic field in the stack is modelled using a finite-difference model. In a previous paper of the authors, ESM and a finite-difference model have been combined to model acoustic wave propagation, though thermal effects and heat flow to the stack plate were excluded. In this paper, however, these effects are included. The performance of the model is studied and compared to linear thermoacoustic theory. The proposed model may provide a useful tool for studying time-varying acoustic fields and temperature distributions in thermoacoustic devices. © S. Hirzel Verlag EAA.",

This article proposes a new reduced-order work-piece dynamic parameters update model using substructuring and perturbation methods. The removed volumes between discrete locations along the toolpath are defined as substructures of the initial global workpiece. The dynamically reduced-order initial work-piece structure and the removed substructures are obtained with model order reduction techniques. Equations of motion of the workpiece are updated in time-domain by rigidly coupling fictitious substructures having the negative mass and stiffness of the removed material. Instead of solving the generalized eigenvalue problem repeatedly along the toolpath, the mode shapes of the in-process workpiece are perturbed using the mass and stiffness of the removed substructures. Convergence of the perturbation is improved by integrating a vector sequence convergence accelerating algorithm. The corresponding updated mode frequencies are evaluated using Rayleigh Quotient with the perturbed mode shapes. The proposed reduced-order time-domain dynamics update model is verified in five-axis ball-end milling tests on a thin-walled twisted fan blade, and its predictions are also compared against the authors' previously developed frequency-domain reduced-order model. It is shown that the newly introduced model is ∼4 times more computationally efficient than the frequency-domain model.",

The formulas, which involve tracking performance between two ends of a transmission line, are similar to those derived by the method of characteristics for lossless and undistorted lossy transmission lines. The algorithm, based on the proposed MMC model, can efficiently evaluate transient responses of high-speed interconnects. It only uses the quantities at two ends of the lines, requiring less computation time and less memory space than required by other methods.

      "Abstract": "A time-domain adaptive numerical method for modeling nonlinear wave propagation is developed. This method is based on a second-generation wavelet collocation using a lifting scheme and makes use of the multilevel decomposition nature of the scheme to allow for automatic grid refinement according to the magnitude of waveform steepening. The multiplication in the nonlinear term is also easy due to the collocation nature. With thresholding, the solution is compact at every level of resolution and computed only at collocation points associated with the remaining significant wavelet coefficients. The error tolerance and compression ratio of the new method are totally controlled by the threshold value used. This brings substantial savings in computation time when compared to the conventional finite difference scheme on a uniformly fine grid. © 2002 Acoustical Society of America.",

The tool is based on the definition of a node, which can have both an instantaneous input-output relation and different state variables (e.g., temperature and carrier density) and differential equations for these states. Furthermore, each node has access to part of its input history, allowing the creation of delay lines or digital filters. Additionally, a node can contain subnodes, allowing the creation of hierarchical networks. This tool can be used in numerous applications such as frequency-domain analysis of optical ring filters, time-domain analysis of optical amplifiers, microdisks, and microcavities. Although we mainly use this tool to model optical circuits, it can also be used to model other classes of dynamical systems, such as electrical circuits and neural networks. © 2012 Optical Society of America.",

The effect of a half-space is taken into account via the simplified reflection/transmission coefficient arising from the modified image theory. The resulting space-time integral equation for the wire above and below ground, respectively, is handled via the time domain Galerkin-Bubnov variant of the indirect boundary element method (GB-IBEM) and some illustrative numerical results are presented.

Furthermore, to compute the basis function coefficient vectors, a fast Sylvester equation solver is proposed, which works more than one or two orders faster than the vector equation solver employed by Chebyshev reduction method. The proposed wavelet method is also compared with the frequency domain model reduction method, which may loose accuracy in time domain.

We present an efficient numerical method for three-dimensional TEM forward modeling. Its key features are based on a correspondence principle between the diffusive and fictitious wave fields. The diffusive Maxwell’s equations are transformed and solved in a so-called fictitious wave domain. This scheme allows larger time steps than conventional FDTD methods, allows including air layers, and allows simulating topography. The need for initial field calculations is avoided by including an electric current source in the governing equations. This also avoids a traditional assumption of a flat earth surface in TEM modeling. We test the accuracy of the electromagnetic fields’ responses using our method with the spectral differential difference (SLDM) solutions. The results show good agreement even under the existence of air layers and topography in the model.",

The model consists of a heterogeneous structure embedded in the bottom layer of a two‐layer half‐space. The compact finite‐element method (CFEM) is used for the vector Helmholtz equation part of the solution. The CFEM combines finite‐element and integral‐equation techniques in a direct, rather than an iterative, solution. The partial use of an isoparametric formulation allows the modelling of a dipping heterogeneous zone without a staircase effect. For sheet‐like models, the technique is consistent with modelling results for resistivity contrasts of up to 300: 1. As an illustrative application, the responses of vertical and dipping prisms, in contact with and below a conductive overburden, are compared. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",

      "Abstract": "In previous applications of the finite element method in modeling mechanical behavior of skeletal muscle, the passive and active properties of muscle tissue were lumped in one finite element. Although this approach yields increased understanding of effects of force transmission, it does not support an assessment of the interaction between the intracellular structures and extracellular matrix. In the present study, skeletal muscle is considered in two domains: (1) the intracellular domain and (2) extracellular matrix domain. The two domains are represented by two separate meshes that are linked elastically to account for the trans-sarcolemmal attachments of the muscle fibers' cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix. With this approach a finite element skeletal muscle model is developed, which allows force transmission between these domains with the possibility of investigating their interaction as well as the role of the trans-sarcolemmal systems. The model is applied to show the significance of myofascial force transmission by investigating possible mechanical consequences due to any missing link within the trans-sarcolemmal connections such as found in muscular dystrophies. This is realized by making the links between the two meshes highly compliant at selected intramuscular locations. The results indicate the role of extracellular matrix for a muscle in sustaining its physiological condition. It is shown that if there is an inadequate linking to the extracellular matrix, the myofibers become deformed beyond physiological limits due to the lacking of mechanical support and impairment of a pathway of force transmission by the extracellular matrix. This leads to calculation of a drop of muscle force and if the impairment is located more towards the center of the muscle model, its effects are more pronounced. These results indicate the significance of non-myotendinous force transmission pathways. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract": "The finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD) method is a counterpart of the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique in the frequency domain. The FDFD method with the 3D perfectly matched layers appears to be a powerful tool in modeling of nanophotonic cavities, e.g. in extraction of resonance wavelengths (λ) and quality factors (Q) of single or degenerate modes. A single simulation run to get mode's eigenfrequency and field profile takes from several minutes up to an hour in a 3D case. Thus, the main FDTD bottlenecks: long execution time and intensive postprocessing to find λ and Q, are overcome with the FDFD employment. In the benchmarking stage as a reference system we use a dipole resonance of a dielectric sphere with known analytical solution. The FDFD-method provides valid results starting from low resolution and exhibits good convergence to analytic values with improvement of discretization. The critical problem of high memory requirements for the FDFD technique can be partly mitigated with use of space reduction through symmetry planes. We also report on modeling ultra high-Q cavities, like single or coupled photonic crystal nanobeams. © 2010 IEEE.",

However, these fluctuations are not synchronized among subjects, which leads to limitations and makes utilization of first-level model-based methods challenging. Considering this limitation of rsfMRI data in the time domain, we propose to transfer the spatiotemporal information of the rsfMRI data to another domain, the connectivity domain, in which each value represents the same effect across subjects. Using a set of seed networks and a connectivity index to calculate the functional connectivity for each seed network, we transform data into the connectivity domain by generating connectivity weights for each subject. Comparison of the two domains using a data-driven method suggests several advantages in analyzing data using data-driven methods in the connectivity domain over the time domain. We also demonstrate the feasibility of applying model-based methods in the connectivity domain, which offers a new pathway for the use of first-level model-based methods on rsfMRI data. The connectivity domain, furthermore, demonstrates a unique opportunity to perform first-level feature-based data-driven and model-based analyses. The connectivity domain can be constructed from any technique that identifies sets of features that are similar across subjects and can greatly help researchers in the study of macro-connectome brain function by enabling us to perform a wide range of model-based and data-driven approaches on rsfMRI data, decreasing susceptibility of analysis techniques to parameters that are not related to brain connectivity information, and evaluating both static and dynamic functional connectivity of the brain from a new perspective.",

      "Abstract": "Software architectural patterns help manage complexity through abstraction and separation of concerns. The most commonly used architectural patterns are layered architectures, which benefit from modularity and reuse of layers. However, they lack in supporting changes, as there is a need to do a substantial amount of rework on the layers in order to incorporate changes. Furthermore, the comprehension of specifications which are based on a layered architecture can be difficult. In order to address the aforementioned limitations, we adopt a domain engineering approach called Application-based Domain Modeling (ADOM). Using ADOM, we refer to each layer as a separate domain model, whose elements are used to classify the application model elements. Consequently, the application model is represented in a unified form, which incorporates information from all of the layers. This allows performing changes in the model, without creating cascades of changes among the layers' models in order to synchronize them. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

This heterogeneity is rarely considered explicitly when describing and validating processes. Handling explicitly such domain knowledge increases design models robustness due to the expression and validation of new properties mined from the domain models. This paper proposes a stepwise approach to enrich design models describing complex information systems with domain knowledge.We use ontologies to model such domain knowledge. Design models are annotated by references to domain ontologies. The resulting annotated models are checked. It becomes possible to verify domain-related properties and obtain strengthened models. The approach is deployed for two design model development approaches: a Model Driven Engineering (MDE) approach and a correct by construction formal modeling one based on refinement and proof using Event-B method.

The dynamics of the commutation inductance and transportation delays during commutation are included in the model, and the sampling of the measurement of firing and extinction angles is added to accommodate actual converters with a finite pulse number (e.g., 12-pulse). The model is validated by comparing the frequency response with one obtained by frequency scanning in an electromagnetic transients (EMT) simulation. The model is shown to be effective in investigating system stability when the LCC is connected to an arbitrary external network. To do this, the frequency response of the combined system is plotted, and the generalized Nyquist stability criterion is applied. This stability result is validated by a time domain simulation on an EMT program using the first CIGRE HVDC benchmark system and the IEEE 14-bus system. Compared to the traditional LCC model, the proposed model is shown to have significantly better accuracy in system stability determination.",

Unfortunately, the method has a voracious appetite for computational resources. For example, to accurately model scattering from a continuously varying pressure-release boundary, an FDTD grid is typically required that has a much finer discretization than is necessary to model propagation in a homogeneous space. Such a fine discretization can become prohibitive when considering large-scale problems. Two simple conformal techniques are presented for acoustic FDTD simulations of problems involving pressure-release boundaries. These techniques, which rely upon splitting velocity cells adjacent to the pressure-release boundary, significantly improve the accuracy of the results over those of the standard 'staircase' representation of the boundary. These methods permit the use of a coarser FDTD grid than would otherwise be practical and yet add negligible computational cost. The improved accuracy of these split-cell techniques is shown for both a spherical scatterer and a spherical resonator.",

For the purpose, firstly, the domain level concepts of SOS are defined from both business process and service representation perspectives. Moreover, a set of traceability rules are devised to draw the correspondence between the business process and service domain concepts of SOS. Further the proposed modelling concepts have been implemented using Generic Modelling Environment (GME) [13] to generate the instance of SOS model in Web Service Description Language (WSDL) and corresponding process description based on Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN).

Evaluation of the converted velocity model as an initial velocity model in an acoustic FWT process indicates the potential of using a combination of these methods to achieve a fully automatic tool for initial-model building in a FWT workflow.

Significant autocorrelation values at lags 1 and 12 indicate that the observations are not random and have a yearly periodicity. Cross-correlations also indicate the yearly periodicity as well as a negative relationship between TDS and DDM, and SPC and TDS. The cross-correlation is positive between SPC and TDS. The spectral and cross-spectral analyses show a significant periodicity at a frequency of v<inf>k</inf> = 0.078 cycles per month, or a period of one year. Because these variables are linearly correlated, an impulse response function can be used to determine the lagging, leading, and/or immediate response of the input(s) on the output. It is found that the best predictor of SPC is DDM. The small contribution from TDS is ignored.

Aiming at designing and analyzing for the complex mechanical products of the multi-field mixture and the sub-hierarchy, the paper studies the product's associated constraints of the different areas' hierarchical relationship, the constitutive constraints expressing the product areas' constitutive relations, the body constraints describing the relationship between the association and the constitution, and the discrete constraints representing the discrete events to extract the commonality in different areas for these four constraints on the basis of the geometric constraints' representation and the physical systems' modeling. In connection with the commonality in the constraints, the products' model formulation in the various fields is unified in the constraint level based on equations using the various structural elements' constraints based on a unified expression of mathematical equations. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",

However, designing of a domain specific language is a difficult task. The design of a domain specific language will evolve as it is used more and more and experienced is gained by its designers. Being able to rapidly develop the implementation infrastructure (interpreter, compiler, debugger, profiler, etc.) of a domain specific language is thus of utmost importance so that as the language evolves, the implementation infrastructure can keep pace. In this paper we present a framework for automatically generating interpreters, compilers, debuggers, and profilers from semantic specification of a domain specific language. We illustrate our approach via the SCR language, a language used by the US defense department for developing control systems. Copyright 2005 ACM.",

      "Abstract": "Earlier modelling studies have shown the difficulty of accurately simulating snowmelt infiltration into frozen soil using the hydraulic model approach. Comparison of model outputs and field measurements have inferred the occurrence of rapid flow even during periods when the soil is still partly frozen. A one-dimensional, physically based soil water and heat model (SOIL) has been complemented with a new two-domain approach option to simulate preferential flow through frozen layers. The ice is assumed to be first formed at the largest water filled pore upon freezing. Infiltrating water may be conducted rapidly through previously air-filled pores which are not occupied by ice. A minor fraction of water is slowly transferred within the liquid water domain, which is absorbed by the solid particles. A model validation with field measurements at a location in the middle-east of Sweden indicated that the two-domain approach was suitable for improving the prediction of drainage during snowmelting. In particular, the correlation between simulated and observed onset of drainage in spring was improved. The validation also showed that the effect of the high flow domain was highly sensitive to the degree of saturation in the topsoil during freezing, as well as to the hydraulic properties at the lower frost boundary regulating the upward water flow to the frozen soil and ice formation.",

      "Abstract": "A new numerical technique for solving 2-D elastodynamic equations based on a finite-volume frequency-domain approach is proposed. This method has been developed as a tool to perform 2-D elastic frequency-domain full-waveform inversion. In this context, the system of linear equations that results from the discretization of the elastodynamic equations is solved with a direct solver, allowing efficient multiple-source simulations at the partial expense of the memory requirement. The discretization of the finite-volume approach is through triangles. Only fluxes with the required quantities are shared between the cells, relaxing the meshing conditions, as compared to finite-element methods. The free surface is described along the edges of the triangles, which can have different slopes. By applying a parsimonious strategy, the stress components are eliminated from the discrete equations and only the velocities are left as unknowns in the triangles. Together with the local support of the P0 finite-volume stencil, the parsimonious approach allows the minimizing of core memory requirements for the simulation. Efficient perfectly matched layer absorbing conditions have been designed for damping the waves around the grid. The numerical dispersion of this FV formulation is similar to that of O (Δ x2) staggered-grid finite-difference (FD) formulations when considering structured triangular meshes. The validation has been performed with analytical solutions of several canonical problems and with numerical solutions computed with a well-established FD time-domain method in heterogeneous media. In the presence of a free surface, the finite-volume method requires 10 triangles per wavelength for a flat topography, and fifteen triangles per wavelength for more complex shapes, well below the criteria required by the staircase approximation of O (Δ x2) FD methods. Comparisons between the frequency-domain finite-volume and the O (Δ x2) rotated FD methods also show that the former is faster and less memory demanding for a given accuracy level, an attractive feature for frequency-domain seismic inversion. We have thus developed an efficient method for 2-D P-SV-wave modelling on structured triangular meshes as a tool for frequency-domain full-waveform inversion. Further work is required to improve the accuracy of the method on unstructured meshes. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 RAS.",

Still, ETL systems are considered very time-consuming, error-prone, and complex involving several participants from different knowledge domains. The ETL processes are one of the most important components of a data warehousing system that are strongly influenced by the complexity of business requirements, their changing and evolution. These aspects influence not only the structure of the data warehouse itself but also the structures of the data sources involved with. To minimize the negative impact of such variables, we propose the use of ETL patterns to build specific ETL packages. In this paper, we formalize this approach using the BPMN for modeling more conceptual ETL workflows, mapping them to real execution primitives through the use of a domain-specific language that allows for the generation of specific instances that can be executed in an ETL commercial tool.",

      "Abstract": "The novel method of Adapted Radiating Boundaries (ARB) is presented for numerical time domain modelling of transient electromagnetic interference between objects separated by the free space. These objects may be of complex shape and of compound structure containing various conducting, dielectric and lossy materials. In the ARB-method, only those spatial regions are discretized, which are occupied by objects. For the numerical modelling of the field inside these object regions, the TLM-method is applied. The treatment of the electromagnetic coupling of the objects across the free space is based on the equivalence theorem in the Huygens-Schelkunoff representation. By this way the self-coupling of the objects as well as the mutual coupling is treated. The equivalence theorem is taken into account also to obtain adapted boundaries of the discretized regions by using discrete TLM-Green's functions, well adapted to the TLM scheme. The ARB-method is a marching-on-in-time method, yielding a fast and stable algorithm. As an example we model the interference of a transient current on a conductor inside a wall with printed circuit boards inside a shielding enclosure. The numerical results of the ARB method are compared with results of the pure TLM method. While the results show a very good agreement, the CPU time required for the ARB method is one order of magnitude less than the CPU-time required for the pure TLM method.

A two-domain modelling approach has been adopted in previous works, but was restricted to specific configurations. The extension to the more general case of a Navier-Stokes modelled fluid over a porous material was not achieved for the twodomain approach owing to the difficulties associated with handling the interfacial boundary conditions. This paper addresses this issue by adopting a one-domain approach, where the governing equations for both regions are combined into a unique set of equations that are valid for the entire domain. It is shown that the nonlinear stability bound, in the one-domain approach, is very sharp and hence excludes the possibility of subcritical instabilities. Moreover, the one-domain approach is compared with an equivalent two-domain approach, and excellent agreement is found between the two. © 2010 The Royal Society.",

The relationship between the polarization vector P and the intensity of electric field E in time domain is obtained by utilizing the transformation relationship from frequency domain to time domain jω → ∂/∂t. Then, the time domain second order equation is solved by using the Newmark β and γ method, which has higher accuracy than the traditional center difference method. Once the recursive formulations for E and P are obtained, the recursive formulations for D and E in time domain can be also obtained based on the constitutive relation. Therefore for a dispersive medium the iterative electromagnetic field calculation is conducted by finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The present numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method is a general algorithm for three kinds of general dispersive medium models, and has higher accuracy than the shift operator-FDTD, which is based on the central difference discrete scheme. © 2014 Chinese Physical Society.",

As an adequate approach, MOCES is capable of modeling physical systems as well as the mainly event-driven behavior of interacting entities and feedback loops across the domains. In addition, it covers timescales from seconds to days. Contrary to other approaches following an agent or co-simulation concept, MOCES is monolithic, based on the modeling language Modelica. To meet the requirements imposed on a simulation tool, we use the possibility to enhance Modelica within its language specification. The basic idea of MOCES is to extend the physical model of each entity by a connected representative in a parallel simulation. To show the feasibility of the concept, a simulation example investigates the benefits and drawbacks of local energy markets.",

The main focus of this paper is to reduce the apparent shift in the deduced resonance frequencies. We show that this shift is completely dependent on the discretisation technique and hence propose a resolution to minimise it. In addition, we discuss the limitations of extracting resonances from the time domain signal obtained from such a numerical model using a FFT and compare complex frequency extraction techniques. We show that, despite its high computational complexity, a modified difference Prony method provides best accuracy. We use this method to show that our proposed method of discretising to maintain resonator area is uniformly convergent with mesh refinement. © 2013 IEEE.",

The authors focus on the non-orthogonal FDTD method, which offers an improved geometric flexibility compared to other standard techniques. Results from numerical electromagnetic analysis methods, such as the FDTD method, are often degraded by an error known as numerical dispersion. For metallic structures this dispersion error is often higher than expected from theoretical considerations. The source of this additional error is due to the reciprocal field interpolation scheme used in the non-orthogonal FDTD algorithm. The error is illustrated by means of a microstrip waveguide and a microstrip antenna. Techniques for reducing this error are evaluated; careful construction of the mesh at the metallic boundary being the most reliable solution. © IEE, 2004.",

In particular, this paper focuses on sub-picosecond pulse formation in a passively mode-locked semiconductor laser. The dynamics and the saturability of the gain and absorption are described by a carrier rate equation. The carrier dynamics are coupled to the electromagnetic field through an effective current density. All parameters of the graphene dynamics are obtained from reported experimental measurements. Using this numerical method, the dependence of output intensity and pulse width on input current density, graphene location, and cavity size is investigated. We find that pulse widths in the range 100-200 fs can be reliably generated with peak output intensities of around 0.15 mWμ2. The optimal placement of the graphene layer in the cavity is strongly dependent on the standing wave pattern near the mirror. We found that cavities as small as 30μm still support stable pulse formation.",

The reduction in the number of grid points increases as the Poisson's ratio becomes larger.

      "Abstract": "In recent years, plasmonic nanoparticles are widely used in a wide range of applications including, biomedicine, spectroscopy, catalysis and energy harvesting. The properties of these particles are due to the interaction of these particles with electromagnetic irradiation that gives rise to the localized surface plasmons that are collective oscillations of their surface conduction electrons. This interaction influences its light absorption and scattering and thus, the particle color. Simulation of particle plasmons can be done by solving Maxwell's equations for metallic nanoparticles embedded in a dielectric environment. One of the approaches to solve Maxwell's equation is by Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) approach. Since FDTD is a time domain approach, the response for a wide range of frequencies can be obtained with a single simulation. In this paper we propose to review the application of FDTD in the simulation and modeling of various plasmonic nanoparticles. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",

Off diagonal elements are computed via system Markov parameters and knowledge of diagonal values. The model reduction technique, involving truncation of the impulse-response gramian, is a variation on that presented by Agathoklis and Sreeram (1990 a). The proposed method evaluates the transfer function of the reduced-order model directly rather than producing a state space representation.

The basic idea behind the approach is to use M2T transformation languages to construct submodels, client application components, and operations on target interpreters. In this manner, M2T transformations may be employed to support not only generation of target platform code from domain-specific graphical language (DSGL) models but also straightforward use of models and appropriate DSM tools as client applications.

      "Abstract": "We compare different finite-difference schemes for two-dimensional (2-D) acoustic frequency-domain forward modelling. The schemes are based on staggered-grid stencils of various accuracy and grid rotation strategies to discretize the derivatives of the wave equation. A combination of two O(Δx2) staggered-grid stencils on the classical Cartesian coordinate system and the 45° rotated grid is the basis of the so-called mixed-grid stencil. This method is compared with a parsimonious staggered-grid method based on a fourth-order approximation of the first derivative operator. Averaging of the mass acceleration can be incorporated in the two stencils. Sponge-like perfectly matched layer absorbing boundary conditions are also examined for each stencil and shown to be effective. The deduced numerical stencils are examined for both the wavelength content and azimuthal variation. The accuracy of the fourth-order staggered-grid stencil is slightly superior in terms of phase velocity dispersion to that of the mixed-grid stencil when averaging of the mass acceleration term is applied to the staggered-grid stencil. For fourth-order derivative approximations, the classical staggered-grid geometry leads to a stencil that incorporates 13 grid nodes. The mixed-grid approach combines only nine grid nodes. In both cases, wavefield solutions are computed using a direct matrix solver based on an optimized multifrontal method. For this 2-D geometry, the staggered-grid strategy is significantly less efficient in terms of memory and CPU time requirements because of the enlarged bandwidth of the impedance matrix and increased number of coefficients in the discrete stencil. Therefore, the mixed-grid approach should be suggested as the routine scheme for 2-D acoustic wave propagation modelling in the frequency domain. © 2004 RAS.",

      "Abstract": "1. Patterns of species richness along latitudinal, elevational and depth gradients often exhibit a mid-gradient peak. Similar patterns with a mid-domain peak in richness are produced, as a result of geometric constraints on species distributions, by models that randomize species range size and placement over a bounded gradient. 2. Proponents of these so-called mid-domain models argue that they provide an appropriate null hypothesis for examining species richness patterns along spatial gradients. Furthermore, some claim that because these models seem to explain a large proportion of the large-scale spatial variation in richness, geometric constraints on species distribution are in fact the cause of these patterns. 3. A critical examination of model assumptions reveals that some are unrealistic, conceptually flawed or internally inconsistent. Additionally, tests of mid-domain models have suffered from methodological deficiencies derived from arbitrariness and circularity in the definition of domain boundaries, collapsing two-dimensional (2-D) patterns into a single dimension (1-D), and the use of interpolated ranges, all of which can bias test results in favour of the models. Tests have also been statistically naive by using fairly insensitive measures of deviation between observed and predicted patterns and ignoring the increased probability of Type I error that can result in analyses of spatially autocorrelated data. 4. In spite of this, a review of the empirical evidence indicates that most studies do not show a high degree of concordance between observed and predicted species richness patterns, particularly in 2-D. Additionally, spatial patterns of variation in range size and species turnover do not unequivocally support mid-domain models. Thus, the models do not adequately describe observed species richness gradients and thus fail to explain them. 5. Although mid-domain models have served a useful purpose in drawing attention to the need to clarify the null expectation in the study of species richness gradients, their use appears to be severely limited by difficulties associated with the treatment of ranges, boundary definitions and a lack of clarity regarding the extent to which the observed data should be used to generate the null patterns.",

Therefore, this paper focuses on the acoustic model estimation given limited in-domain transcribed speech data, and large amounts of (typically available) transcribed out-of-domain data. First, we evaluate several combinations of known methods to optimize the adaptation/training of acoustic models on the limited in-domain speech data. Then, we propose to use Gaussian sharing to combine in-domain models with out-of-domain models, and a data generation process to simulate the presence of more speakers in the in-domain data. In a spoken language dialog application, we contrast our methods against an upper accuracy bound of 69.1% (model trained on many in-domain data) and a lower bound of 60.8% (no in-domain data). Using only 2 hours of in-domain speech for model estimation, we improve the accuracy by 5.1% (to 65.9%) over the lower bound; data generation and Gaussian sharing contribute 2.2% to this improvement. With 9 hours of in-domain speech, the improvement of accuracy is 6.5%, to 67.3%.",

These input oscillations generate other output oscillations that can be analyzed with the help of the ZMP measurement system. The proposed ZMP modeling approach not only considers classical rigid body model uncertainties but also non-modelled robot mechanical structure vibration modes. The non-linear ZMP model is obtained following three consecutive stages: Equivalent inverted pendulum dynamics, where saturation and acceleration upper bounds are taken into account, non-modelled inverted pendulum dynamics, including non-linear effects, and low-pass dynamics defining the system cut-off frequency.

Connecting the wall positions in each time frame the evolution of the domain shape in the formation process is obtained. By applying this method to Tb23Fe 77 thin film, it is found that the domain wall in Tb 23Fe77 thin film on a moving disk was first pinned in the cooling region which was the leading region of laser exposure on the disk, then the pinned wall expanded toward the heating region, and a closed domain was formed after the laser was turned off.",

      "Abstract": "A method for universal combat platform simulator development based on domain model and component technology is proposed. On the high abstraction level, domain model can be used to obtain demand model in the special domains, based on which different business objects should be mapped to different components. Basic Framework describes the combat platform commonness and provides its variety extensions in which corresponding components can be integrated into the simulator. In this way, all kinds of combat platform simulators can be developed. This method is capable to capture domain commonness and control variability successfully. For this reason, the reusability and interoperability of a military simulation software are both greatly improved. © 2010 IEEE.",

The model is independently useful as a communication tool.\" We introduce two additional layers of abstraction between human domain experts and operational software: a shared Knowledge Model of the domain, and Visualisation mockups/prototypes. Tools of the methodology include: DSLs and graphical representations; Qualitative analysis of the DSLs; Semantic Metadata for Test Driven Design; and analysis of concurrently evolving Visualisation output mockups/prototypes. In our experience, following this methodology helped us escape from situations where we had completely ceased to be able to make any modelling progress at all, while even at times when we were able to make easy progress in our KE tasks, M(krDSL) gave us a high degree of confidence in the correct prioritisation and correct results of our work. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.",

      "Abstract": "Simulation plays an important part in the design process of modern mechatronic systems. To meet the strong quality requirements of such systems, the behavior of all subsystems and components has to be taken into account. Thus, the design tools and techniques have to be capable of dealing with subsystems of various physical domains such that the design engineer can be provided with particular knowledge about the interactions of subsystems. One important mechatronic system is the electrical drive since it comprises subsystems of several different physical domains the properties of which being all of special examination interest. The quality of motion strongly depends on the interactions of these subsystems. Furthermore, the quality constraints of such systems regarding dynamics and accuracy increased considerably in the past years. This paper first introduces the SIMPLORER1 simulation package and its unique multi-domain modeling approach with simulation backplane technology. Thereafter, its novel mechanical system simulation module is presented. A digitally position controlled worm drive example concludes. Copyright © 2000 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",

      "Abstract": "The finite-difference time-domain method is a simple but powerful numerical method for simulating full-wave acoustic propagation and scattering. However, the method can demand a large amount of computational resources. Traditionally, continuously curved boundaries are represented in a stair-step fashion and thus accurately modeling scattering from a boundary will require a finer discretization than would otherwise be necessary for modeling propagation in a homogeneous medium. However, a fine discretization might not be practical due to limited computational resources. A locally conformal technique is presented here for modeling acoustic scattering from continuously curved rigid boundaries. This technique is low cost, simple to implement, and gives better results for the same grid discretization than the traditional stair-step representation. These improvements can be traded for a coarser discretization which reduces the computational burden. The improved accuracy of this technique is demonstrated for a spherical scatterer. © 2003 Acoustical Society of America.",

By rigorously applying effective medium theory the physical existence of a subcell dielectric sphere in the FDTD grid is translated into an equivalent material, characterized by an effective permittivity that obeys the Clausius-Mossotti (CM) mixing rule, appropriately defined across the cell edge parallel to the excitation plane wave. A circuit based methodology is devised that allows to easily incorporate the effective medium representation of a subcell dispersive dielectric sphere into FDTD update equations.

In previous research efforts the capabilities and potential of a Bayesian belief network (BN) model-based approach to support situation assessment have been demonstrated. In our own prior research, we have presented and formalized a hybrid process for situation assessment model development that seeks to ameliorate specific concerns and drawbacks associated with using a BN-based model construct. Specifically, our hybrid methodology addresses the significant knowledge acquisition requirements and the associated subjective nature of using subject matter experts (SMEs) for model development. Our methodology consists of two distinct functional elements: an off-line mechanism for rapid construction of a Bayesian belief network (BN) library of situation assessment models tailored to different situations and derived from knowledge elicitation with SMEs; and an on-line machine-learning-based mechanism to learn, tune, or adapt BN model parameters and structure. The adaptation supports the ability to adjust the models over time to respond to novel situations not initially available or anticipated during initial model construction, thus ensuring that the models continue to meet the dynamic requirements of performing the situation assessment function within dynamic application environments such as an AOC. In this paper, we apply and demonstrate the hybrid approach within the specific context of an AOC-based air campaign monitoring scenario. We detail both the initial knowledge elicitation and subsequent machine learning phases of the model development process, as well as demonstrate model performance within an operational context.",

The method is implemented in the time-domain finite-element method (TDFEM) analysis of multiport microwave waveguide devices with arbitrary metallic and dielectric discontinuities. It is based on the geometrical modeling using Lagrange-type interpolation generalized hexahedra of arbitrary geometrical-mapping orders, field expansion in terms of hierarchical curl-conforming 3-D polynomial vector basis functions of arbitrarily high field-approximation orders, time stepping with an implicit unconditionally stable finite-difference scheme invoking the Newmark-beta method, and mesh truncation introducing the waveguide port boundary condition. Numerical examples demonstrate excellent accuracy, efficiency, stability, convergence, and versatility of the presented method, and very effective large-domain TDFEM models of 3-D waveguide discontinuities using minimal numbers of large conformal finite elements and minimal numbers of unknowns. The results obtained by the higher order TDFEM are in an excellent agreement with indirect solutions obtained from the FEM analysis in the frequency domain (FD) in conjunction with the discrete Fourier transform and its inverse, as well as with measurements and with alternative full-wave numerical solutions in both time and FDs. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",

GSD is a combination of two existing methods (SD with ORM). By combining these two methods we generate synergy effects by using already existing modeling methods and by so doing we overcome some of the weaknesses of SD model building. Secondly, transformation of information from an ORM model of dynamic domains into an SD model is achieved. To apply the GSD procedure to a real-life case (Mukono Health Center (MHC), we use SD-ORM mapped constructs. As a result from the GSD procedure application, is an SD model to which we define quantitative foundations that result into simulations. Our approach(GSD) has been validated using case studies one of which is described in this paper. From this conclusions are drawn. © 2011 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",

      "Abstract": "© 2016 IEEE.The domain model is one of the important components used by adaptive e-learning systems to generate customized courses for the learners. The domain model acts as a data repository that consists of topics, contents, pages or nodes, and navigation links related to the design structure of the represented data. The most important aspect of the domain model is the relations between the course elements in other word the navigation links between pages which are used to decide upon adaptations. In this paper we propose a generation of an adaptive e-learning domain model based on fuzzy logic approach. Our approach uses a predefined domain model provided by expert of a specific field. However to allow the experts to find the best domain model in order to adapt the learners' differences, we consider that the prerequisite relations between the concepts in predefined domain model are fuzzy relations, and they could be established with a certain percentage of uncertainty fixed by the experts. Indeed, we generate many intermediate domain models using various combinations of four parameters of fuzzy logic, then we use the percentage of uncertainty to calculate similarity index between intermediate domain models and predefined domain model by expert, finally we provide the final domain model.",

In these systems, there could be a number of dynamic interactions and frequency coupling between network and loads and other converters. Hence, time-domain simulations are usually required to consider such a complex system behavior. However, simulations in the time domain may increase the calculation time and the utilization of computer memory. Furthermore, frequency coupling driven by multiple converters with different switching frequencies or harmonics from ac-dc converters makes that harmonics and frequency coupling are both problems of ac system and challenges of dc system. This paper presents the modeling and simulation methods of a large dc system by using the harmonic state space (HSS) modeling. Through this method, the required computation time and CPU memory can be reduced, where this faster simulation can be an advantage of a large network simulation. Besides, the achieved results show the same results as that of the nonlinear time-domain simulation. Furthermore, the HSS modeling can describe how the frequency components are coupled with each other through the different switching frequency of each converter.",

This technique is based on computing the cross-gramian matrix from the state-space representation of the full-order filter in an arbitrary frequency range of operation. The modified cross-gramian is derived in the frequency domain and computed by solving only one Lyapunov equation. This technique does not require a minimal system to start with, and the reduced order can be obtained without calculating the conventional balancing transformation. Instead, orthonormal bases are computed to find the left and right eigenspaces associated with the large eigenvalues of the modified cross-gramian matrix. These eigenspaces are used to convert the high-order to a reduced-order models. The phase linearity is also discussed and it is shown that the proposed method can be used to transform a linear-phase FIR filter to a reduced-order IIR filter and the phase linearity is preserved over the interested frequency band, which is commonly be the passband. A comparison between the conventional time-domain methods such as balanced truncation (BT) and optimal Hankel-norm approximation (OHA); and the proposed frequency-domain model reduction technique is presented through several filters design examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. © 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

The main interest of mixing solvers is to overcome the huge memory complexity of direct solvers while partially preserving efficient multi-RHS simulations and mitigating the iteration count in iterative solvers. To improve the convergence rate of the iterative solver, a preconditioning based on an additive Schwartz approach is used. Discretization of the Helmholtz equation is based on a parsimonious finite-difference method but the domain decomposition method could apply to any numerical scheme such as finite-element or finite-volume methods and to any media such as elastic, anisotropic ones ...

Structural/non-structural building fabric components, such as ventilated concrete slabs (VCS) can actively store and release thermal energy effectively by passing air through their embedded air channels. These building components can be described as ventilated BITES systems. To assist the thermal analysis and control of BITES systems, modeling techniques and guidelines for FR and LPFD models of VCS are presented in this two-part paper. In this first part, modeling techniques for FR and LPFD approaches based on network theory are presented. A method for calculating the heat transfer between flowing air and ventilated components is developed for these two approaches. Discretization criteria for explicit LPFD models are discussed. For the FR approach, discrete Fourier series in complex frequency form are used to represent the boundary excitations. In the treatment of heat injection from the flowing air as internal source in the VCS, network techniques such as Thévenin theorem, heat flow division, and Y-diakoptic transform are employed. The techniques presented in this paper are applicable to other BITES with hydronic or electric charging/discharging systems. With the FR techniques, model-based control strategies based on transfer functions can be readily developed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Abstract": "©, 2015, Science Press. All right reserved.Seismic anisotropy exists extensively in the earth, whereas the TI medium is the most common anisotropic one. The conventional finite difference modeling (FDFDM) of 2D VTI media frequency-space domain with 9-point scheme can cause serious numerical dispersion because of its poor computational accuracy. The average-derivative optimal method (ADM) not only is suitable for equal and unequal directional sampling intervals, but also retains high precision. We introduce this idea into the qP wave equation of 2D VTI media to improve the computational accuracy. We firstly deal with the P-SV wave phase velocity dispersion equation for VTI media and derive the frequency-space domain qP wave equation for 2D VTI media following Alkhalifah's TI acoustic approximation theory. Then we propose a new kind of qP wave equation for 2D VTI media with a second-order 9-point FDFDM scheme based on ADM. Specifically, we represent the finite-difference approximations of the second-order centered spatial-derivative terms as the weighted average of 3 grid points in orthogonal directions and the acceleration term as the weighted average of all 9 grid points. Afterwards we use the least-square optimal method to resolve the optimized coefficients of the VTI media with the ADM 9-point scheme and perform numerical dispersion analysis towards this new scheme. The results show that the ADM 9-point scheme for VTI media can decrease the required number of grid points per wavelength from 12 to 3.57 bounded by a phase velocity error range of 1%. Therefore this scheme significantly increases the computational accuracy of VTI media FDFDM compared to the VTI media conventional 9-point scheme. So the VTI media ADM 9-point scheme allows using a larger grid interval in the modeling and obviously improves the computational efficiency. Finally we derive the 2D VTI media ADM 9-point frequency-space domain with the perfectly matched layer (PML) wave equation and perform seismic wave modeling in the frequency-space domain. We use a complex BP2007 2D VTI ocean standard model to verify the validity and precision of the VTI media ADM 9-point scheme. As the VTI media conventional 9-point scheme is also suitable for unequal directional sampling intervals, we use this scheme for comparison. The horizontal sampling interval and the vertical sampling interval are 10 m and 4 m, respectively, so the ratio of the horizontal sampling interval to the vertical sampling interval comes to 2.5. The VTI media parameters include P-wave velocity and Thomsen anisotropic parameter. The frequency-space domain wavefield characteristic of qP wave is very clear and depicts well from the 35 Hz monochromatic wavefield computed by the VTI media ADM 9-point scheme. The simulation result with this scheme is accurate while the result with VTI media conventional 9-point scheme exhibits errors due to numerical dispersion. The simulation results also demonstrate the VTI media ADM 9-point scheme is in good agreement with the high-precision time domain 12-order finite difference scheme for VTI media. It is worth mentioning that the frequency-space domain PML absorbing boundary condition eliminates the artificial boundary reflection very well. The numerical example proves the precision and validity of the VTI media ADM 9-point scheme. We propose a new VTI ADM 9-point scheme which obviously increases the computational precision of VTI FDFDM compared to the VTI media conventional 9-point scheme. We obtain the optimized coefficients by the least-square method and decrease the required grid points per wavelength from 12 to 3.57. The numerical example demonstrates that the VTI ADM 9-point scheme can not only possess high computational precision and computational efficiency, but also possess applicability and flexibility. The VTI ADM 9-point scheme can be developed further and has many applications. Taking FWI for example, the VTI ADM 9-point scheme can be applied to the VTI FWI as a fast and accurate modeling engine.",

      "Abstract": "A finite difference formulation for the equations of SH waves in viscoelastic media has been developed and applied to the problem of an infinite half space with a buried source emitting a compressional pulse. A dispersion relation has been developed by employing the finite difference (FD) method, which has been used to discuss the stability criteria and also for obtaining the relation for phase and group velocities in viscoelastic media. Furthermore, the effect of variation of stability parameter on phase and group velocities; effect on the wave propagation with increase in dispersion parameter; and change in the wave propagation at different locations from the source have also been studied. The SH waves are found to be dispersive in viscoelastic media. The phase velocity increases with decrease in stability parameter. Furthermore, the location of the source has an important effect on the strength of the wave propagation in that the intensity of wave and therefore its longevity is inversely proportional to the distance from the source, implying that the wave will progressively die out exponentially. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.",

Exterior boundary conditions for the computational problem over a finite domain are derived from an exact relation between the solution and its derivatives on that boundary. Galerkin, Galerkin/least-squares and Galerkin/gradient least-squares finite element methods are evaluated by comparing errors pointwise and in integral norms. The Galerkin/least-squares method is shown to exhibit superior behavior for this class of problems. © 1991.",

Two of them are based on physical model simplifications, and the other two improve the numerical computation. The case study demonstrates the efficiency of these approaches.

The test is made to pass by writing a constant transformer that unconditionally outputs the result. At each step the language is extended by refactoring: Some part of the transformer template is converted from a constant subtree to a reference to data read from the source tree, thus driving additions to the new language. Optionally, each refactoring step can be driven by a new test that demonstrates the lack of parameterization of some part of the final product.",

Acquisition architecture frameworks (AF) are metamodels, developed to model the whole enterprise/system life cycle stages including system procurement. Our previous study analyzed the currently used AFs such as DoDAF, MoDAF and TRAK to assess their adequacy and efficiency in modelling the infrastructure projects. The results showed that many of the procurement related concerns are overlooked such as financial matters e.g. cost and revenue calculation; and risk management aspects e.g. risk calculation and risk allocation. This paper focuses on identifying the procurement concerns and adding new viewpoints to the architecture frameworks; and developing a domain specific language based on SysML to model the new viewpoints. A methodology is provided which shows how the metamodel (abstract syntax) and the language stereotypes (concrete syntax) are developed. The results firstly show the 18 identified viewpoints of procurement domain and then one of them (project funding) is chosen to be described in this paper. The conceptual definition of the 'project funding' viewpoint and the models it generates are illustrated as example diagrams of this DSL. This DSL can be used by the domain practitioners, who are the contracting officers and procurement managers, to generate the contracting materials to facilitate the contracting process, assure the consistency of the procurement documents, giving better project outcomes.",

Unlike most existing methods such as the ones using curvilinear grids to fit irregular surface topography, we use a regular Cartesian grid system without suffering from the staircasing error that occurs in conventional implementations. In this improved embedded-boundary method, we use the method of images, by imposing ghost nodes above the surface and approximating their acoustic pressures using linear extrapolation, quadratic interpolation, or cubic interpolation, to account for an arbitrarily curved surface. Implementing this method instead of using curvilinear grids near the boundaries greatly reduces the complexity of preprocessing procedures and the computational cost. Furthermore, using numerical examples, we found the accuracy gain and performance of our embedded-boundary methods in comparison with conventional finite-difference implementation of the problem.",

First, the impulse responses between any pair of terminals of lines are obtained by the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. In this calculation, the characteristic impedance of the interconnect is imposed at every terminal in order to converge quickly the transient waveforms. Next, the frequency responses are obtained by the Fourier transform of these transient waveforms. Then, the time-domain models are synthesized from the frequency responses by using the least square approximation and the complex frequency hopping technique. Finally, with this model, the transient responses are rapidly simulated by the conventional circuit simulators.

It combines the ability to account for complex wave effects like reflection, scattering and diffraction near arbitrary objects, and complex medium effects like convection, refraction and (turbulent) scattering. In addition, it has the general advantages of a time-domain method. It is indicated that the numerical discretisation scheme should be chosen depending on the flow speed of the background medium. Perfectly matched layers, applicable to cases in presence of (non-)uniform flow, are state-of-the-art perfectly absorbing boundary conditions that are key in outdoor sound propagation applications, where only a small part of the unbounded atmosphere can be numerically described. Various ways to include outdoor soils are summarized, like time-domain impedance plane boundary conditions and explicitly including the upper part of the soil in the simulation domain. Approaches for long-distance sound propagation, including moving calculation frames and hybrid modeling are discussed. This review deals with linear sound propagation only.",

The primary field is obtained by Hankel transform from the frequency-domain for a half-space or layered earth model. The techniques of local mesh and direct solver are adopted to further improve the modeling efficiency. We compare and discuss the characteristics of the method developed in this paper from time consumption and grid sizes. The EM responses for different transmitting waveforms are calculated via a convolution between step-wave responses and the transmitting current or its derivatives.

In this paper the easyABMS methodology is proposed to overcome the lack of integrated methodologies able to seamlessly guide domain experts from the analysis of the system under consideration to its modeling and analysis of simulation results. The effectiveness of easyABMS is also experimented through a case study in the logistics domain which concerns the analysis of different policies for managing vehicles used for stacking and moving containers in a transhipment terminal. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Since the computation of stress components taking into account time-dependent fundamental solutions is quite elaborate and computationally demanding, this work reviews this procedure considering combined methodologies to evaluate the stress fields. In this context, coupled and hybrid formulations are discussed here. Taking into account coupling procedures, standard, iterative and direct coupling techniques are presented, being the time-domain boundary element method coupled with the domain boundary element method and with the finite element method. For the hybrid formulation, some concepts of the finite element method are introduced into the time-domain boundary element method, avoiding in this way most of its inconveniences considering the dynamic analysis of inelastic models. At the end of the paper, numerical examples are presented, illustrating the accuracy and potentialities of the discussed methodologies.",

The proposed formulations allow modeling different dispersive materials, such as Debye, Drude, and Lorentz models, in the same manner. The stability of the formulations was studied by means of the Routh-Hurwitz and von Neumann criterion and found to maintain the conventional FDTD stability constrains.

The methodology is well suitable for situations when constructing the accurate deterministic grammar is not a trivial task or the higher flexibility is required. In the case of in-vehicle infotainment, the key idea is to decrease the cognitive load of the driver during controlling such a system and also to make designing process less time consuming.

From the experience of working with mobile telephony systems for over three years, it is the author's belief that the huge amount of variance in application logics, not the diversity of hardware platforms, is the major obstacle to the development of embedded software. A domain specific language (DSL) for modelling the user interface (UI) architecture of embedded software, especially focusing on telephony applications is proposed. With the proposed DSL, developers can describe the UI architecture of applications by the fundamental domain concepts at a higher level of abstraction. The proposed DSL is based on the concept of scene. A scene is proposed as a unit of UI in the UI architecture and UI-related behaviours are associated with scenes. The result of a pilot project conducted in a major company dedicated to developing mobile telephony applications is also described. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2006.",

On the other hand, AIS standards have the potential to stifle innovation (when they are too strict) or become irrelevant or meaningless (when they are too loose). The cost of re-engineering current systems to accommodate standards presents a further barrier to implementation. In order to maximize the benefits of standardization, I propose a focus on three key areas: domain models, student models, and assessment methods. I offer examples of how standards might be implemented in these areas, outlining the challenges and benefits. Graph models, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and Item Analysis are discussed.",

In this work, an analytical formulation for high impedance fault location in power distribution systems is presented, based on system parameters estimation. The proposed method is based on a frequency domain system model, developed considering a high impedance fault model composed by two antiparallel diodes and an arc resistance. The proposed model is an overdetermined nonlinear algebraic system of equations in which the solution is obtained through a Weighted Least Square approach. A residual analysis is applied for estimate selection. The proposed method considers the capacitive effect through an exact line segment model for overhead distribution lines, using only local voltages and currents as input data. Validation is done through numerical simulations using the IEEE system 13 buses test feeder, a real distribution system from the RGE Sul Power Utility (Southern Brazil), and a real high impedance fault recorded from a digital relay. Comparative test results with the state-of-the-art highlights the method's high accuracy, indicating potential aspects for real life application. Overall average errors of 0.3% considering a complete HIF model were obtained, and a 1.39% error considering a real HIF in a rural feeder. The formulation is currently used by protection engineers at RGE Sul as a reliability oriented tool.",

To better manage these distributed energy sources/loads and reduce harmonic pollution, establishing more accurate harmonic source models for them becomes very necessary. Traditionally, harmonic source is described as a fixed-parameter model, which is not good enough to describe time-varying harmonic source. In this paper, a time-domain modeling method is firstly explained, which enables the study on time-varying harmonic source model. Then two different data segmentation algorithms to support this model based on the stability of current magnitude and phase angle are developed and explained respectively using a group of data acquired from field. One is developed from statistical perspective while the other is based on slope of curve. Comparison is presented to explain their unique characteristics and synthesizing of both algorithms is also illustrated. The results of algorithms are shown to be satisfactory. ©2009 IEEE.",

(GSSI) 1.5-GHz antenna and a MALÅ Geoscience 1.2-GHz antenna - using simple analyses of the geometries and the main components of the antennas. Values for unknown parameters in the antenna models (due to commercial sensitivity) were estimated by using Taguchi's optimization method, resulting in a good match between the real and modeled crosstalk responses in free space. Validation using a series of oil-in-water emulsions to simulate the electrical properties of real materials demonstrated that it was essential to accurately model the permittivity and dispersive conductivity. When accurate descriptions of the emulsions were combined with the antenna models, the simulated responses showed very good agreement with real data. This provides confidence for use of the antenna models in more advanced studies. © 2011 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.",

The massive electronic data from a computer numerical control (CNC) system during the work processes of a CNC machine tool is the main source of the big data on which a CPS model is established. In this work-process model, a method based on instruction domain is applied to analyze the electronic big data, and a quantitative description of the numerical control (NC) processes is built according to the G code of the processes. Utilizing the instruction domain, a work-process CPS model is established on the basis of the accurate, real-time mapping of the manufacturing tasks, resources, and status of the CNC machine tool. Using such models, case studies are conducted on intelligent-machining applications, such as the optimization of NC processing parameters and the health assurance of CNC machine tools.",

      "Abstract": "The two-domain concept is widely used in modelling transport in heterogeneous porous media and transport of rate-limited sorbing contaminants. When a first-order kinetic relationship is used to represent the transfer of mass between domains, the model can be expressed as a modified advection-dispersion equation describing general transport coupled to a first-order ordinary differential equation accounting for mass transfer. Different approaches can be used to solve the resulting system, including: simultaneously solving the coupled transport and kinetic equations; discretising and algebraically solving the mass transfer equation and substituting it into the transport equation; solving the mass transfer equation analytically and substituting the integral solution into the transport equation to obtain a single integro-differential equation; and solving the system in Laplace space and back-transforming the solution into the time domain. These four approaches - coupled, algebraic substitution, integro-differential, and finite element Laplace transform (FELT) - are evaluated on the basis of their general features and on their performance in two test cases. The results indicate that the algebraic substitution approach is robust and, on scalar computers, very efficient. The FELT approach is easily parallelised and achieves good speed-up on supercomputers, but the method is restricted to time-invariant velocity and saturation fields, and is only useful for obtaining the solution at or not too far from the maximum simulation time. The integro-differential method is as efficient as but less robust than the algebraic substitution approach, requiring a small time step size when the mass transfer coefficient is very large. Finally, the coupled approach is robust and flexible, but requires the solution of a system of equations twice as large as the other methods. On balance, the algebraic substitution and, to a lesser extent, the integro-differential methods appear to be the most attractive approaches on scalar machines while FELT, when applicable, is an appealing alternative for coarse-grained multiprocessors.

      "Abstract": "Long QT syndrome, LQTS, results in serious cardiovascular disorders, such as tachyarrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. A promiscuous binding of different drugs to the intracavitary binding site in the pore domain (PD) of human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) channels leads to a similar dysfunction, known as a drug-induced LQTS. Therefore, an assessment of the blocking ability for potent drugs is of great pragmatic value for molecular pharmacology and medicinal chemistry of hERGs. Thus, we attempted to create an in silico model aimed at blinded drug screening for their blocking ability to the hERG1 PD. Two distinct approaches to the drug blockage, ligand-based QSAR and receptor-based molecular docking methods, are combined for development of a universal pharmacophore model, which provides rapid assessment of drug blocking ability to the hERG1 channel. The best 3D-QSAR model (AAADR.7) from PHASE modeling was selected from a pool consisting of 44 initial candidates. The constructed model using 31 hERG blockers was validated with 9 test set compounds. The resulting model correctly predicted the pIC50 values of test set compounds as true unknowns. To further evaluate the pharmacophore model, 14 hERG blockers with diverse hERG blocking potencies were selected from literature and they were used as additional external blind test sets. The resulting average deviation between in vitro and predicted pIC50 values of external test set blockers is found as 0.29 suggesting that the model is able to accuretely predict the pIC50 values as true unknowns. These pharmacophore models were merged with a previously developed atomistic receptor model for the hERG1 PD and exhibited a high consistency between ligand-based and receptor-based models. Therefore, the developed 3D-QSAR model provides a predictive tool for profiling candidate compounds before their synthesis. This model also indicated the key functional groups determining a high-affinity blockade of the hERG1 channel. To cross-validate consistency between the constructed hERG1 pore domain and the pharmacophore models, we performed docking studies using the homology model of hERG1. To understand how polar or nonpolar moieties of inhibitors stimulate channel inhibition, critical amino acid replacement (i.e., T623, S624, S649, Y652 and F656) at the hERG cavity was examined by in silico mutagenesis. The average docking score differences between wild type and mutated hERG channels was found to have the following order: F656A > Y652A > S624A > T623A > S649A. These results are in agreement with experimental data. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",

      "Abstract": "Model checking is an established method for verifying behavioral properties of system models. But model checkers tend to support low-level modeling languages that require intricate models to represent even the simplest systems. Modeling complexity arises in part from the need to encode domain knowledge at relatively low levels of abstraction. In this paper, we demonstrate that formalized domain knowledge can be reused to raise the abstraction level of model and property specifications, and hence the effectiveness of model checking. We describe a novel method for domain-specific model checking called cascading verification that uses composite reasoning over high-level system specifications and formalized domain knowledge to synthesize both low-level system models and their behavioral properties for verification. In particular, model builders use a high-level domain-specific language (DSL) based on YAML to express system specifications that can be verified with probabilistic model checking. Domain knowledge is encoded in the Web Ontology Language (OWL), the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) and Prolog, which are used in combination to overcome their individual limitations. A compiler then synthesizes models and properties for verification by the probabilistic model checker PRISM. We illustrate cascading verification for the domain of uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAVs), for which we have constructed a prototype implementation. An evaluation of this prototype reveals nontrivial reductions in the size and complexity of input specifications compared to the artifacts synthesized for PRISM. Copyright 2013 ACM.",

In contrast, the approach presented in this paper focuses on BPM and SOA environments in a domain-dependent and platform-independent way. We propose to add a domain specific layer on top of current solutions so business stakeholders can design and understand their processes in a more intuitive way. We rely on previously proposed technical solutions and integrate them in an end-to-end methodology (from design to monitoring and back).

This papers presents the tools we built to automate the mapping of high level business and system models to the source code.

The applicability of this approach to rotation machinery is then considered. In order to overcome difficulties arising from phase shift and random measurements, the statistical performance of the vibration of rotation machinery is analysed in both time and frequency domains. A consistence model is developed using stochastic process theory. After model validation, the model-based approach is implemented in AC motor fault detection. The residual is generated by comparing the new measurement and the model prediction, by both subtraction and division. Fault detection results prove that the model-based approach is applicable to fault feature extraction for rotation machinery in the frequency domain. Copyright © 2006 by ASME.",

This paves the need to investigate various topic modeling approaches which are used to infer knowledge from a large corpora. In this paper, we mileage various topic modeling techniques which include Latent Semantic Indexing, Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Hierarchical Dirichlet Process. In this process, the baseline language model is dynamically adapted to different topics and the results are analyzed for these three topic modeling approaches.",

We describe experiments wherein we apply our approach to the task of matching two real, open-source applications to corresponding industry-standard domain models.

In response to these problems, we propose an awareness ontology that conceptualizes some of the most important aspects of awareness in a specific kind of system: collaborative systems for carrying out modeling activities. The awareness ontology brings together and extends a series of ontologies we have developed in the past. The ontology is prepared to better meet the specific implementation needs of a model-driven development approach. In order to validate the usefulness of this ontology, we relate its concepts to the awareness dimensions set out in Gutwin and Greenberg's framework, and we apply the ontology to two systems presently in use. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Plane waves and a phased array were first studied to numerically validate the model. It is shown that the left-point Riemann sum, trapezoidal, and Simpson¿s integration have first-, second-, and third-order global accuracy, respectively. A highly focused therapeutic transducer was then used for experimental verifications. Short high-intensity pulses were generated. 2-D scans were conducted at a prefocal plane, which were later used as the input to the numerical model to predict the acoustic field at other planes.

Then, models are manipulated with the goal of enabling the automated development of a system from its corresponding models. Unlike general-purpose modeling languages, domain-specific modeling languages can simplify the development of complex software systems by providing domain-specific abstractions for modeling the system and its transformations in a precise but simple and concise way. In this work we elaborate on the notion of domain specific model manipulation language, that is to say a model manipulation language tailored to a specific domain. In contrast to wellknown model manipulation languages, such as EOL or ATL, the language syntax and semantics are directly related to a specific domain and/or kind of manipulation, making manipulation easier to write and understand. We present an implementation approach achieving complete platform-independence. We illustrate the proposal through a practical example.",

The proposed numerical algorithm is based on the two-grid discretization technique, the combined finite element-upwind finite volume method and some other appropriate linearization schemes. The original nonlinear partial differential equations are only solved on the coarse grid while the fine grid approximation solution is obtained linearly. Therefore the computational time can be reduced tremendously compared with the traditional one-grid method. Numerical experiments of the two-grid method and conventional method for a two-phase mixed-domain fuel cell model are carried out, showing that the presented method is effective and accurate for the numerical simulation of PEMFC. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

With application of the leapfrog ADI scheme, a uniform time-step can now be applied to the entire solution domain without temporal and spatial interpolation between different computational regions. Furthermore, in the proposed scheme, implicit updating of field variables is confined only within the regions of densely-distributed nodes, yielding a significant saving in memory overhead and a further reduction in CPU time in comparison with leapfrog ADI-RPIM and original RPIM, respectively. © 2012 ACES.",

Previous algorithms for modeling narrowband and wideband Lorentzian dispersive materials using the FDTD method have been based on a recursive convolution technique. They present two different and independent algorithms for the modeling of the narrowband and wideband Lorentzian dispersive materials, known as the narrowband and wideband Lorentzian recursive convolution algorithms, respectively. The proposed alternative algorithm may be used as a general algorithm for both narrowband and wideband Lorentzian dispersive materials modeling with the FDTD method. The second-order motion equation for the Lorentzian materials is employed as an auxilary differential equation. The proposed auxiliary differential-equation-based algorithm can also be applied to solve the borderline case dispersive electromagnetic problems in the FDTD method. In contrast, the narrowband and wideband Lorentzian recursive convolution algorithms cannot be used for the borderline case. A rectangular cavity, which is partially filled with narrowband and wideband Lorentzian dispersive materials, is presented as a numerical example. The time response of the electric field z component is used to validate and compare the results. © 2007 IEEE.",

This method is applied to the three-dimensional (3D) frequency-domain marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) modeling with the towed transmitters and receivers located at the seafloor. We simulate the 3D marine CSEM responses by the staggered finite-difference method with a direct solver. The secondary-field approach is used for avoiding the source singularities and the primary fields excited by the electric dipole source could be calculated quasi-analytically for the one-dimensional layered background. Therefore, in this study, we focus on interpolating of electric and magnetic fields to the receiver locations at the seafloor interface between the conductive seawater and resistive seafloor formation. Considering the discontinuity of the normal electric fields, we use the normal current electric density for interpolation. The secondary electric and magnetic fields are also used for interpolation instead of the total fields for high numerical accuracy. The proposed interpolation only utilizes the nodes below/above the seafloor interface and is approved to be much more accurate than other tested interpolating methods, i.e., the conventional linear interpolation and the rigorous interpolation.",

In this letter, we propose a wave-equation-based spatial finite-difference method that discretizes a solution domain in space but not in time. It is based on the spatial eigen decompositions of the field solutions without approximations to temporal derivatives in Maxwell's equations. The solutions of the proposed method are derived analytically, and the field solutions at any time can then be found quickly. The effectiveness and accuracy of this proposed method are numerically validated with examples.",

Guaranteeing the quality of early models is essential for a successful application of MDE techniques and related tool-supported model refinements. Do these models properly reflect the requirements elicited from the owners of the problem domain? Ultimately, this question needs to be asked to the domain experts. The problem is that a gap exists between the respective backgrounds of modeling experts and domain experts. MDE developers cannot show a model to the domain experts and simply ask them whether it is correct with respect to the requirements they had in mind. To facilitate their interaction and make such validation more systematic, we propose a methodology and a tool that derive a set of customizable questionnaires expressed in natural language from each model to be validated. Unexpected answers by domain experts help to identify those portions of the models requiring deeper attention. We illustrate the methodology and the current status of the developed tool MOTHIA, which can handle UML Use Case, Class, and Activity diagrams. We assess MOTHIA effectiveness in reducing the gap between domain and modeling experts, and in detecting modeling faults on the European Project CHOReOS.",

A variety of approaches has been developed in the past, which is capable of tackling the soil-structure interaction problem from different perspectives. The popular approach of a discretized truncated finite element model of the soil domain is not always a numerically viable solution, especially for computationally demanding simulations such as the probabilistic fragility analysis of a bridge structure or the real time hybrid simulation. This paper aims to develop a complete modeling procedure that is capable of coping with the soil-structure interaction problem of inelastic bridge structures through the use of a frequency dependent lumped parameter assembly. The proposed procedure encounters accuracy and global stability issues observed on past methods while maintaining the broad applicability of the method by any commercial FEM software. A case study of an overpass bridge structure under earthquake excitations is illustrated in order to verify the proposed method.",

      "Abstract": "Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is frequently used to determine parameters like frequency, amplitude, and phase; however, the finite length of data being used often leads to errors. Modeling a signal process in time-domain and estimating model parameters from observed data will provide a prediction about the data outside the sampled window and thus may lead to a better estimation of the signal spectrum. Many models were developed in literature for this purpose. While these models can provide better spectrum estimation than DFT, they may not be the best option because the parameter estimation is only suboptimal of least squares or the methods have very narrow convergence area. In this paper, the traditional nonlinear separable estimation has been modified and a new time-domain least-squares method was developed for the identification of multi-frequency signal parameters. Algorithm convergence was analyzed and improved through segmentation of data. Simulations and an experiment were provided to validate the effectiveness of the developed method. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab srl.",

All rights reserved.Many authors have shown that the effective design of viscoelastic systems can be conveniently carried out by using modern mathematical models to represent the frequency- and temperature-dependent behavior of viscoelastic materials. However, in the quest for design procedures of real-word engineering structures, the large number of exact evaluations of the dynamic responses during iterative procedures, combined with the typically high dimensions of large finite element models, makes the numerical analysis very costly, sometimes unfeasible. It is especially true when the viscoelastic materials are used to reduce vibrations of nonlinear systems. As a matter of fact, which the resolution of the resulting nonlinear equations of motion with frequency- and temperature-dependent viscoelastic damping forces is an interesting, but hard-to-solve problem. Those difficulties motivate the present study, in which a time-domain condensation strategy of viscoelastic systems is addressed, where the viscoelastic behavior is modeled by using a four parameter fractional derivative model. After the discussion of various theoretical aspects, the exact and reduced time responses are calculated for a three-layer sandwich plate by considering nonlinear boundary conditions.",

Especially large robots applied to real-world scenarios may cause injuries or even human death and must therefore be classified as safety-critical. In this paper, a generic approach to defining and executing purposeful test runs using domain-specific languages (dsls) is presented. Test cases can be defined in an appropriate test description language (first dsl). These test cases can be derived automatically using a model-based testing approach, for which a test model has to be created. Hence, a second dsl for the creation of the test model is presented. It is further shown how the generated test cases are automatically executed and evaluated. The paper concludes with the application of the approach to the autonomous off-road robot ravon. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

      "Abstract": "© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.Multi-agent systems (MASs) include multiple interacting agents within an environment to provide a solution for complex systems that cannot be easily solved with individual agents or monolithic systems. However, the development of MASs is not trivial due to the various agent properties such as autonomy, responsiveness, and proactiveness, and the need for realization of the many different agent interactions. To support the development of MASs various domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) have been introduced that provide a declarative approach for modeling and supporting the generation of agent-based systems. To be effective, the proposed DSMLs need to meet the various stakeholder concerns and the related quality criteria for the corresponding MASs. Unfortunately, very often the evaluation of the DSML is completely missing or has been carried out in idiosyncratic approach. If the DSMLs are not well defined, then implicitly this will have an impact on the quality of the MASs. In this paper, we present an evaluation framework and systematic approach for assessing existing or newly defined DSMLs for MASs. The evaluation is specific for MAS DSMLs and targets both the language and the corresponding tools. To illustrate the evaluation approach, we first present SEA_ML, which is a model-driven MAS DSML for supporting the modeling and generation of agent-based systems. The evaluation of SEA_ML is based on a multi-case study research approach and provides both qualitative evaluation and quantitative analysis. We report on the lessons learned considering the adoption of the evaluation approach as well as the SEA_ML for supporting the generation of agent-based systems.",

There are certain common beliefs about the advantages/disadvantages of these approaches. However, it is hard to be objective and speak in favor of a particular one, since these implementation approaches are normally compared over diverse application domains. The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical results from ten diverse implementation approaches for domain-specific languages, but conducted using the same representative language. Comparison shows that these discussed approaches differ in terms of the effort need to implement them, however, the effort needed by a programmer to implement a domain-specific language should not be the only factor taken into consideration. Another important factor is the effort needed by an end-user to rapidly write correct programs using the produced domain-specific language. Therefore, this paper also provides empirical results on end-user productivity, which is measured as the lines of code needed to express a domain-specific program, similarity to the original notation, and how error-reporting and debugging are supported in a given implementation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

      "Abstract": "Model (In)Validation has been extensively studied during the past decade, leading to efficient algorithms to establish whether some a priori information, typically a given model, uncertainty and noise description, is consistent with some observed experimental data. These algorithms are optimistic in the sense that a given description is considered to be not invalidated by the experimental data when there exists at least one pair (noise, uncertainty) that together with the nominal model can reproduce the observed data. Thus, they can substantially underestimate the size of the model uncertainty, leading to poor performance or even instability when this information is used to design a robust controller. To solve this difficulty, in this paper we take a pessimistic approach, where we seek the smallest ball such that the resulting model is invalidated by the experimental data for all uncertainties outside this ball. Thus, a robust controller designed using this information is guaranteed to stabilize the unknown plant. The main result of the paper provides an LMI-based optimization procedure for computing an upper bound on the radius of this ball for the case of structured uncertainty entering the plant in an LFT form. Moreover, in the case of up to two uncertainty blocks this upper bound is indeed exact. © 2007 IEEE.",

Rational approximation exploiting the vector fitting algorithm (VF) is used for deriving the closed-form impulse response of a multiple diffraction ray creeping on a cascade of convex obstacles. The VF algorithm is performed with respect to new generalized variables proportional to frequency but also taking into account geometrical parameters of the obstacles. The limits of the approximation domain for the VF algorithm reflect the range of UWB channel parameters that can be met in practical UWB channel scenarios. The results of VF approximation have the form of a finite series of partial fractions in the frequency domain, which then is easily transformed to the time domain. Obtained in this way, impulse response is a sum of exponential functions. As a consequence, in simulations of electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation, we can implement very fast and effective convolution algorithms with any input signal or perform simulations implementing SPICE-like programs.",

This paper presents an intrusive PC-FDTD method stemming from a wavelet-based PC expansion of field components, with respect to the uncertain parameters. This multi-resolution expansion implements a sparse adaptive grid in the uncertain parameter space, which produces significant performance gains, without sacrificing accuracy. © 2014 IEEE.",

In this way, a procedure for the evaluation of vehicle performance is accomplished within the developed simulation environment.

      "Abstract": "© 2015 The authors.During the many phases in the lifecycle of a building, an ever growing number of dynamic and static aspects are encountered that seem worthy of modelling in a computer-readable representation. Product models that attempt to cover the concepts from the many disciplines or phases in a product's lifecycle face a dilemma, namely maintaining a balance between growing model complexity on the one hand, and user requests for additional concept coverage on the other. In examining the main principles of model theory (Stachowiak 1973) more closely, this paper tries to identify tendencies that may hamper the balance between complexity and completeness. However, a scientific evaluation of model complexity needs objective measures. Metrics for the assessment of software complexity are readily available and can also be applied to models, since models (schema or instance) can automatically be transformed into a programming language (Hartmann, von Both 2010) or an instance structure. These metrics can therefore be helpful in the discussion about model complexity. Different approaches have been taken to handling model complexity and the complex process of modelling itself. Leal S. et al. (2014) develop a template-based model generating tool for energy simulation models to evade the lossy and complex recourse to IFC or gbXML models. Cao J. et al. (2014) use a transformation tool to generate building energy performance simulation models in order to reduce the complexity otherwise encountered in traditional building simulation programs. Thomas D. et al (2014) combine a CitySim model holding a simplified representation of the surrounding buildings with models for the EnergyPlus building performance engine. This allows for rapid assessment of the performance of the early design-stage building information models (BIM) on both the building and urban systems scale. Koene F. et al. (2014) take the reductionist idea of model theory a step further by reducing a building to a simple model consisting of two thermal masses. The Building Lifecycle Management Department at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology KIT conducts analyses beyond the scope of a single building. Analyses often have to take the urban environment into account, meaning that not only building models but also models of the surrounding city area are potentially involved. From the modelling standpoint this raises the question as to whether the city model and building models should be unified into one \"super model\", or whether models should be kept separate and the relations between them expressed by means of meta data. The work presented is a result of the research project \"A model-driven approach to the integration of product models into cross-domain analysis processes\" (original title: \"Ein modellgetriebener Ansatz zur Integration von Produktmodellen in domänenübergreifende Analyseprozesse\") sponsored by the federal German research funding organization 'Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)'.",

      "Abstract": "© 2015 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.The electrical and electronic systems (E/E-Systems) in the automotive world have been getting more and more complex over the past decades. New functionality, which is mainly realized through embedded E/E-Systems, as well as the growing connectivity (Car2X-Communication), will keep this trend alive in the upcoming years. Additionally, new standards and regulations have been released during the last years (e.g. ISO 26262), which leads to an even higher system complexity. Therefore, well-defined development processes are crucial to manage this complexity and achieve high quality products. To accomplish an appropriated guidance through these processes, a tool chain has to be established, which supports each phase of the E/E-System development. However, it isn't enough to provide a stand-alone solution for the assistance at each phase. A smooth transition of the development artefacts between the different levels as well as their bilateral traceability is crucial. Common approaches utilize tools like Enterprise Architect or Artisan Studio to model the E/E-System design in SysML or a kind of UML2 profile. Usually, several abstraction layers are designed with these tools, starting from the system architectural design down to the software architectural design. Although, in the majority of cases the design should represent a mechatronics-based system, the hardware as well as the mechanics view is not considered. The aim of this work is to remedy the deficiencies regarding the missing representation of hardware and mechanics artefacts within the E/E-System design. Therefore, a model-based domainspecific language was developed that describes the system in a more comprehensive way. Additionally, it makes it easier for domain experts, who are not that familiar with UML or SysML, to create an architectural design. Furthermore, the already existing SysML models are not ignored at the presented methodology, but supported through a translator, which converts the DSL model into a SysML representation.",

      "Abstract": "As an important phase in software development, domain modeling can be used to construct reusable domain assets based on common domain requirements. In service-oriented software development, domain modeling is essential to satisfy users' personalized requirements in a short time and at a low cost. We have proposed a method named O-RGPS for service-oriented domain modeling. In O-RGPS, goal models and process models are two kinds of important domain models that have tight relations. However, process modeling is not an easy task in domain modeling since the process models are usually very complicated, and some properties and relations have the risk of being missed. Towards this problem, this paper proposes an automatic process model generation approach by transforming the goal model. Algorithms for generating process models are designed by sufficiently analyzing decomposition and dependence relations in the goal model and transforming these relations into the process model. Furthermore, the method has been realized in a domain modeling prototype, which aims at helping domain experts in domain modeling. The experiments show that this method can help to reduce modeling time and improve the quality of models during creating process models. © 2010 IEEE.",

The proposed framework provides an abstraction to represent domain-specific concepts at both modeling and programming layers by leveraging the notions of UML and attribute-oriented programming. At the modeling layer, domain-specific concepts are represented as a Domain Specific Model (DSM), which is a set of UML 2.0 diagrams. At the programming layer, domain-specific concepts are represented as a Domain Specific Code (DSC), which consists of program elements and attributes associated with them. The proposed framework transforms domain-specific concepts from the modeling layer to programming layer, and vise versa, by providing a seamless mapping between DSMs and DSCs. The proposed framework transforms a DSM and DSC into a more detailed model and program that specialize in a particular implementation and deployment technologies. Finally, the framework combines the specialized DSM and DSC, and generates the final (compilable) source code. This paper describes the design and implementation of the proposed framework, and discusses how the framework can improve the productivity to implement domain-specific concepts.",

Current effectiveness simulation researches attempt to cope with the structural and behavioral complexity of CoSES based on a unified technological space, and they are limited to their existing modeling paradigms and fail to meet these two requirements. In this work, we propose a model framework-based domain-specific composable modeling method to solve this problem. This method builds a common model framework using application invariant knowledge for CoSES, and designs domain-specific modeling infrastructures for subdomains as corresponding extension points of the framework to support the modeling of application variant knowledge. Therefore, this method supports domain-specific modeling in multiple subdomains and the composition of subsystem models across different subdomains based on the model framework. The case study shows that this method raises the modeling abstraction level, supports generative modeling, and promotes model reuse and composability.",

      "Abstract": "Homology modeling requires an accurate alignment between a query sequence and its homologs with known three-dimensional (3D) information. Current structural modeling techniques largely use entire protein chains as templates, which are selected based only on their sequence alignments with the queries. Protein can be largely described as combinations of conserved domains, and already more than two-third of the known protein domains can be found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We presented a method to improve structural modeling based on conserved domain clusters. First, we searched and mapped all the InterPro domains in the entire PDB, partitioned and clustered homologous domains into the domain-based template library. For each of the resulting clusters created, a multiple structural alignment was generated based only on the 3D coordinates of all the residues involved. Then we used the structural alignments as anchors to increase the alignment accuracy between a query and its templates, and consequently improve the quality of predicted structure for query protein. We implemented the method on DAWNING 4000A cluster system. The preliminary results show that our domain-based template library and the structure-anchored alignment protocol can be used for the partial prediction for a majority of known protein sequences with better qualities. © 2006 IEEE.",

Parallelism is implemented by domain decomposition. The modeling is purposely developed for frequency-domain full-waveform inversion (FWI) in 3D elastic media. We designed an efficient and computationally-efficient CPML absorbing condition by combining two interpolation orders in the computational domain: we used the DG P2 scheme in the medium to get the required accuracy while we used the low-order DG P0 scheme in the CPMLs to reduce the whole numerical cost and to obtain a well-balanced workload over processors. The use of the lowinterpolation orders has been driven by the theorical resolution of FWI, which constrains the spatial discretization of the medium, and hence, the required interpolation order. We applied the proposed method to the SEG/EAGE overthrust model. The measured computation times of the modeling provide clear insights on the feasibility of 3D elastic FWI.",

The method attempts to combine the desirable attributes of Krylov reduction and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and is entitled Krylov enhanced POD (KPOD). Design/methodology/approach: The KPOD method couples Krylov's moment-matching property with POD's data generalization ability to construct reduced models capable of maintaining accuracy over wide frequency ranges. The method is based on generating a sequence of state- and frequency-dependent Krylov subspaces and then applying POD to extract a single basis that generalizes the sequence of Krylov bases. Findings: The frequency response of a pre-stressed microelectromechanical system resonator is used as an example to demonstrate KPOD's ability in frequency domain model reduction, with KPOD exhibiting a 44 per cent efficiency improvement over POD. Originality/value: The results indicate that KPOD greatly outperforms POD in accuracy and efficiency, making the proposed method a potential asset in the design of frequency-selective applications.",

A disadvantage of the prevailing algorithms is the need to deduce different formulations for each dispersion model. In this paper, the shift operator finite difference time domain (SO-FDTD) method is developed. First, we prove that the complex permittivity of three kinds of general dispersive media models, i. e. Debye model, the Lorentz model and the Drude model, may be described by rational polynomial functions in jw. By introducing a shift operator zt, the constitutive relation between D and E is derived in discretised time domain. The shift operator method is then applied to the general dispersive medium case. The recursive formulation for D and E available for FDTD. computation is obtained. Finally, the scatterings by a dispersive sphere and a PEC object covered with dispersive media are computed. The computed results are in good agreement with the literature and the one obtained by Mie's series solution. This illustrates the generality and the feasibility of the presented scheme.",

The domain complexion plays the part of a memory function so that systems having the same macroscopic static thermodynamic state may have different domain complexions, and, if so, will differ in their future behaviour in a way dependent on their past histories. Exact methods are derived for deducing from experimental data the distribution functions characterizing a system, and for testing the quantitative validity of the theory in any particular case.

Using this model, a region map of the defect image is produced on-line through likelihood calculations, accumulated in a coarse-to-fine manner in the wavelet domain. As expected, the region map is basically separated into two regions: 1) the defects, and 2) the background. A level-set segmentation technique is then applied to this region map to locate the defects. This approach is tested with images of defective fabric, as well as x-ray images of cotton with trash. The proposed method shows promising preliminary results, suggesting that it may be extended to a more general approach of defect detection.",

In order to increase the transmission rate of downlink system, it is necessary to study mathematical model of the downlink communication channel. In this paper, a frequency-domain model of the downlink communication for the bypass downlink system is established based on the transfer matrix method, which describes the relationships between the transmitted flow rate pulses from the downlink equipment on the surface and the received voltage signals from downhole turbine generator, and can be used to predict downhole signal waveform. The prediction result is compared to that of the method of characteristic (MOC) algorithm and validated by the experiments.

We used the curlcurl electric field equation to carry out the analysis. In each subdomain, the electric field was discretized by first-order vector shape functions along the edges of tetrahedral elements. The tangential components of the magnetic field on the interfaces of the subdomains were defined as a set of Lagrange multipliers. The unknown Lagrange multipliers were solved from an interface problem defined on the interfaces of the subdomains. With the availability of the Lagrange multipliers, the electric field values in each subdomain were solved independently. Three synthetic examples were evaluated to verify our code. Excellent agreement with previously published solutions was obtained. Synthetic examples revealed that our domain decomposition technique is scalable with respect to the number of subdomains and robust with regard to frequency and the heterogeneous distribution of material parameters, i.e., electric conductivity, electric permittivity, and magnetic permeability.",

      "Abstract": "There has been a recent increase in the use of controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) surveys in the exploration for oil and gas. We developed a modeling scheme for 3D CSEM modeling in the frequency domain. The electric field was decomposed in primary and secondary components to eliminate the singularity originated by the source term. The primary field was calculated using a closed form solution, and the secondary field was computed discretizing a second-order partial differential equation for the electric field with the edge finite element. The solution to the linear system of equations was obtained using a massive parallel multifrontal solver, because such solvers are robust for indefinite and ill-conditioned linear systems. Recent trends in parallel computing were investigated for their use in mitigating the computational overburden associated with the use of a direct solver, and of its feasibility for 3D CSEM forward modeling with the edge finite element. The computation of the primary field was parallelized, over the computational domain and the number of sources, using a hybrid model of parallelism. When using a direct solver, the attainment of multisource solutions was only competitive if the same factors are used to achieve a solution for multi right-hand sides. This aspect was also investigated using the presented methodology. We tested our proposed approach using 1D and 3D synthetic models, and they demonstrated that it is robust and suitable for 3D CSEM modeling using a distributed memory system. The codes could thus be used to help design new surveys, as well to estimate subsurface conductivities through the implementation of an appropriate inversion scheme. © 2012 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.",

Different from the prevailing static models which assume the heat balance always holds between PV modules and local environments, the proposed method also considers the thermal dynamics before the heat balance is reached. To that end, time domain differential equations are established to describe the thermal dynamics using the standard heat transfer model in physics. With Laplace transform (F(s){colon equals}L[f(t)]=∫0∞f(t)e-stdt), these differential equations are then converted equivalently into the frequency domain 2nd-order transfer function model with time delay, i.e., H(s) = (b1s + b0)e - Ls / (s2 + a1s + a0), so that many mature frequency domain system identification methods can be utilised to determine the unknown model parameters of a i, b i (i = 0, 1), and L. Recursive square algorithm is also applied to minimise the modelling error. The proposed method is applied to both c-Si and a-Si PV modules from Photon Lab module test facility at Aachen, Germany, and compared with the measurement data of module temperatures for the full year of 2012. Both case studies consistently show significant improvements in accuracy, as compared to the existing thermal models.

Domain-specific languages, i.e., languages providing only constructs relevant to a particular domain, provide a solution that balances these constraints. Safety and security can be ensured using verification techniques that exploit the restricted nature of such languages. Strategies have been developed for the compilation of domain-specific languages that provide both portability and efficiency. This paper presents a synthesis of work on the PLAN-P domain-specific language for programmable routers. We present the language design, representative experiments that have been carried out using the language, and new compilation strategies. End-to-end performance is typically comparable to that of hand-coded C implementations.",

      "Abstract": "© 2018 Association for Computing Machinery. All rights reserved.Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are of increasing importance in scientific high-performance computing to reduce development costs, raise the level of abstraction, and, thus, ease scientific programming. However, designing DSLs is not easy, as it requires knowledge of the application domain and experience in language engineering and compilers. Consequently, many DSLs follow a weak approach using macros or text generators, which lack many of the features that make a DSL comfortable for programmers. Some of these features-e.g., syntax highlighting, type inference, error reporting-are easily provided by language workbenches, which combine language engineering techniques and tools in a common ecosystem. In this article, we present the Parallel Particle-Mesh Environment (PPME), a DSL and development environment for numerical simulations based on particle methods and hybrid particle-mesh methods. PPME uses the Meta Programming System, a projectional language workbench. PPME is the successor of the Parallel Particle-Mesh Language, a Fortran-based DSL that uses conventional implementation strategies. We analyze and compare both languages and demonstrate how the programmer's experience is improved using static analyses and projectional editing, i.e., code-structure editing, constrained by syntax, as opposed to free-text editing. We present an explicit domain model for particle abstractions and the first formal type system for particle methods.",

In this context, models are used to discover emergent properties arising from the complex interactions between components. Most available tools propose simulation frameworks to study models of biological systems. Simulation only explores a limited number of behaviors of these models. This may lead to a biased view of the system. On the contrary, model checking explores all the possible behaviors. The use of model checking in the domain of life sciences is limited. It suffers from the complexity of modeling languages designed by and for computer scientists. This article describes an approach based on Domain Specific Languages. It provides a comprehensible, yet formal, language called GReg to describe genetic regulatory mechanisms and their properties, and to apply powerful model checking techniques on them.

This paper presents how a wizard tool can produce user interfaces to such tasks according to a model-driven approach based on a domain model of the information system. This process consists of seven steps: database selection, data source selection, building the opening procedure, data source selection for control widgets, building the closing procedure, setting the size of the widgets, and laying them out. The wizard generates code for Visual Basic and eMbedded Visual Basic, thus enabling to obtain support for both stationary and mobile tasks simultaneously, while maintaining consistency. © 2004 ACM.",

We first derive the discretization of frequency-domain wave equations via numerical schemes based on the nearly analytic discrete (NAD) method to obtain a linear system. The coefficients of numerical stencils are optimized to make the linear system easier to solve and to minimize computing time. Wavefield simulation and numerical dispersion analysis are performed to compare the numerical behavior of DNAD method with that of the conventional NAD method. The results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. Finally, the DNAD method is implemented in frequency-domain FWI, and high-resolution inverse results are obtained.",

Beyond that, people involved in providing the technical infrastructure and people conducting the analysis often do not share the same skill set. Productivity gains could be expected, if one side could concentrate on the conceptual-part of the analysis and the other part could focus into the implementation-part of digital model analysis.

The FDM employs thin-shell theory to model the cylindrical steel pile and the acoustic wave equation to model the water and fluid seabed, while the FEM employs the elastic and acoustic wave equations to model sound propagation in the pile and water/fluid seabed respectively. A one-way coupling of the pile displacements to the fluid pressures is utilised in the FDM to model the acoustic radiation from the pile excitation, while the FEM employs a fully coupled fluid-structure interaction at the solid-fluid interface. Numerical results for both models are presented in the form of pile radial displacement results and pressure results in the near field of the pile. Good agreement is observed between the FDM and FEM models, while the FDM is observed to be at least twice as fast as the FEM for the considered models.",

We present comparisons of simulated data using the Finite-Integration Technique, the Finite-Difference Time-Domain method, and a Time-Domain Integral Equation approach, as well as measured data. For each scenario, phase, amplitude, and the shape of the waveform were compared. Generally we found very good agreement between the different simulation techniques, and good agreement between experimental and simulated data. Differences that were evident highlight the significance of understanding how features such as antenna feeding and material dispersion are modelled. This degree of match between experimental and simulated data cannot be attained by using just an infinitesimal dipole model in a simulation - a model including the structure of the antenna is required. This is important for the many GPR applications which operate in the near-field of the antenna, where the interaction between the antenna, the ground, and targets is important.",

Least squares estimate is then used to find the optimal coefficients in the numerator polynomials of the reduced models so that the unit step response errors are reduced to a minimum. The advantages of the proposed method are that both frequency domain and time domain characteristics of the original systems can be preserved in the reduced models, and the reduced models are always stable provided the original models are stable. © 1981.",

The cellbased method has proven to delineate stress-free conditions correctly at the free surface with just changes in the material properties, which indicates that it can also properly deal with subsurface interface boundaries. In the acoustic-elastic coupled modeling, we first compose finite differences individually for the acoustic and elastic media; we then combine the differences using fluid-solid interface boundary conditions. Numerical experiments show that the cell-based coupled modeling algorithm gives solutions compatible with analytic solutions and that it properly describes S- and converted waves as well as P-waves. Applying the cell-based coupled modeling algorithm to a slope model, we confirm that our coupled modeling algorithm describes irregular interfaces properly, although it employs a staircase approximation of them. © The Association of Korean Geoscience Societies and Springer 2009.",

      "Abstract": "© 2014 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.To decouple the parameters in elastic full-waveform inversion (FWI), we evaluated a new multistep-length gradient approach to assign individual weights separately for each parameter gradient and search for an optimal step length along the composite gradient direction. To perform wavefield extrapolations for the inversion, we used parallelized high-precision finite-element (FE) modeling in the time domain. The inversion was implemented in the frequency domain; the data were obtained at every subsurface grid point using the discrete Fourier transform at each time-domain extrapolation step. We also used frequency selection to reduce cycle skipping, time windowing to remove the artifacts associated with different source spatial patterns between the test and predicted data, and source wavelet estimation at the receivers over the full frequency spectrum by using a fast Fourier transform. In the inversion, the velocity and density reconstructions behaved differently; as a low-wavenumber tomography (for velocities) and as a high-wavenumber migration (for density). Because velocities and density were coupled to some extent, variations were usually underestimated (smoothed) for VP and VS and correspondingly overestimated (sharpened) for ρ. The impedances IP and IS from the products of the velocity and density results compensated for the under- or overestimations of their variations, so the recovered impedances were closer to the correct ones than VP, VS, and ρ were separately. Simultaneous reconstruction of VP, VS, and ρ was robust on the FE and finite-difference synthetic data (without surface waves) from the elastic Marmousi-2 model; satisfactory results are obtained for VP, VS, ρ, and the recovered IP and IS from their products. Convergence is fast, needing only a few tens of iterations, rather than a few hundreds of iterations that are typical in most other elastic FWI algorithms.",

      "Abstract": "© The Authors 2017.2-D seismic modelling has notable dynamic information discrepancies with field data because of the implicit line-source assumption, whereas 3-D modelling suffers from a huge computational burden. The 2.5-D approach is able to overcome both of the aforementioned limitations. In general, the earth model is treated as an elastic material, but the real media is viscous. In this study, we develop an accurate and efficient frequency-domain finite-element method (FEM) formodelling 2.5-D viscoelasticwave propagation. To performthe 2.5-D approach, we assume that the 2-D viscoelastic media are based on the Kelvin-Voigt rheological model and a 3-D point source. The viscoelastic wave equation is temporally and spatially Fourier transformed into the frequency-wavenumber domain. Then, we systematically derive the weak form and its spatial discretization of 2.5-D viscoelastic wave equations in the frequency-wavenumber domain through the Galerkin weighted residual method for FEM. Fixing a frequency, the 2-D problem for each wavenumber is solved by FEM. Subsequently, a composite Simpson formula is adopted to estimate the inverse Fourier integration to obtain the 3-D wavefield. We implement the stiffness reduction method (SRM) to suppress artificial boundary reflections. The results show that this absorbing boundary condition is valid and efficient in the frequency- wavenumber domain. Finally, three numerical models, an unbounded homogeneous medium, a half-space layered medium and an undulating topography medium, are established. Numerical results validate the accuracy and stability of 2.5-D solutions and present the adaptability of finite-element method to complicated geographic conditions. The proposed 2.5-D modelling strategy has the potential to address modelling studies on wave propagation in real earth media in an accurate and efficient way.",
