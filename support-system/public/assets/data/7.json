      "Title": "Exploiting Blockchain and Smart Contracts for Data Exploration As a Service",
      "Abstract": "Digital transformation and the adoption of ICT technologies in the factory of the future are growing faster and faster. In particular, data exploration methods and techniques are enabling the development of data-intensive Remote Monitoring Services for anomaly detection and predictive maintenance purposes. Remote Monitoring Services involve different actors across organizations. The Original Equipment Manufacturer explores high volume of data collected by sensors on the monitored machines to provide anomaly detection and predictive maintenance services. Insurance agencies may provide support to sustain maintenance costs. Spare parts suppliers can schedule the delivery of mechanical parts required for maintenance interventions. In this scenario, trust among participants becomes a critical issue. On the one hand, providers of anomaly detection and predictive maintenance services as well as insurance agencies must trust the way machines have been used by collecting and analysing sensors data. On the other hand, owners of monitored machines must trust the use of collected data to implement services, based on which maintenance costs are calculated. The goal of this paper is to leverage blockchain and smart contracts to ensure the required level of trust when implementing data exploration for Remote Monitoring Services. Events occurring on the monitored machines are stored as transactions in a blockchain-based system, to ensure non repudiation. Moreover, trust-demanding services are implemented as smart contracts, to guarantee the required level of trustworthiness among participants. The approach is integrated with a tool for data exploration in the digital factory, and has been validated taking into account performances and cost requirements.",

      "Title": "Systematization of Digital Twins: Ontology and Conceptual Framework",
      "Abstract": "The development and progress in information and communication technologies will transform traditional products into smart products and allow to offer novel smart services [1]. Herein, the digital twin (DT) concept is regarded as a key technology to create value with smart services [2]. Although the research and applications of DTs emerge continuously many concerns are to be scrutinized [3]. The lack of a shared conceptual framework for DTs with an unambiguous terminology [4] complicates cross-functional discussions. Therefore, a systematization of the main dimensions of DTs is proposed in the form of an ontology and a conceptual framework thereof derived. The research questions addressed in this paper are a) «Which dimensions are used to classify and structure DTs in academic literature?», b) «What are the fundamental differences or specifications within these dimensions?» and c) «How do these different specifications relate to each other?» The focus of the research is on the objective to find classification systematics that are a) representing the entire spectrum of DTs, b) universally valid in all DT related domains and c) applicable in research and practice. A systematic literature review on the relevant aspects of DTs was conducted and the findings iteratively advanced within workshop sessions with academic experts. DTs are considered as integrators of physical and digital worlds as well as internal and external value creation. Further, the creation of DTs requires per definition the use of digital data. Hence, the proposed ontology and conceptual framework for DTs include the following main dimensions to consider for every DT: Data resources, external value creation and internal value creation. The main subdimensions of the data resources are the data sources to obtain the data, the data categories and the data formats. The main subdimension of the external value creation are the attributes of the services as the basis of the value propositions, the level of smartness of the connected products and the actors on the different levels of the ecosystem. The main subdimensions of the internal value creation are the lifecycle phases of products, the product management levels and the different generations of both. The proposed ontology and conceptual framework support researchers and practitioners in positioning and structuring their intended DT activities and communicating them to internal and external stakeholders. The holistic view on the data resource dimension further allows to easily deduct the needed data for certain applications or deduct possible applications from already available data.",

      "Abstract": "Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) fully integrate computational and physical processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. Industry 4.0, otherwise known as the fourth industrial revolution, integrates people and digitally controlled machines with the internet and information technology. The most commonly used terms to describe the new development that is changing the industrial aspects, are Industry 4.0, Cyber-physical Systems, and the Internet of Things (IOT), which pave the way for smart production factories and the digital transformation. Models of CPS of Industry 4.0 (CPSI 4.0) present a high level of combination and coordination between physical and computational elements aiming to improve productivity and decrease production costs. This paper introduces a testbed for a cyber-physical system of Industry 4.0. The testbed is a serial line equipped with sensors to collect data at both the machine and system level. Various tools were utilized to aggregate, analyze, and display this data and prepare it for processing over the cloud. The implemented system leverages many of Industry 4.0 features such as predictive maintenance, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), condition monitoring, communication technology and simple cyber-physical system security. The work presented is the basis for building a larger research testbed that could allow multidisciplinary research projects in this domain.",

      "Abstract": "Collaboration of batteryless nodes is essential to their success in replacing traditional battery-based systems. Energy-harvesting sensor nodes experience spatiooral fluctuations of energy availability. These fluctuations become especially critical when sensor nodes do not have sufficient energy storage to compensate for them. Understanding the challenges and opportunities of operating groups of batteryless sensor nodes requires to record and reproduce spatiooral characteristics of real energy environments. We thus present Shepherd, a testbed for the batteryless IoT. Shepherd allows to record synchronized energy traces with a resolution of 3 µA and 50µV at a rate of 100 kHz, and to faithfully replay these traces to any number of sensor nodes to study their behavior. We release Shepherd as an open-source tool for the community, facilitating research into time synchronization, wireless networking, and other distributed algorithms for batteryless systems.",

Examples are Vehicle-to-X applications, Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) or functionalities in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Currently, there is no comprehensive solution allowing to efficiently program, deploy, and operate such distributed applications. This paper will focus on real-time concerns, in building distributed CPS and IoT systems. Thereby, the focus lies, on the one hand, on mechanisms required inside of the IoT (compute) nodes, and, on the other hand, on communication protocols such as TSN and 5G connecting them. In the authors' view, the required building blocks for a first end-to-end technology stack are available. However, their integration into a holistic framework is missing.",

      "Abstract": "The mechanical engineering and related industries are increasingly being dominated by information and communication technology, leading to the development of cyber-physical systems. However, these systems have to be seen from a broader angle, incorporating several other environmental factors such as the organizational structure or human factors. For this reason, the technology cannot be seen as solitary system, but should rather be included in the context of a scenario of work 4.0. These scenarios can help to classify new technologies, their advantages and constraints in order to provide guidance for the digital development of organizations. While several frameworks have been proposed in terms of technological guidance, most of them focus heavily on technology, neglecting their organizational- and human factors. In order to form a uniform understanding of the construct of industry 4.0, we developed an instrument for rating scenarios of work 4.0 on the relevant dimensions 'technology', 'human' and 'organization'. This paper describes the chosen relevant criteria including possible constraints we encountered. Future work on this topic will include the creation of profiles of scenarios of work 4.0, further validation of the criteria.",

      "Abstract": "A major challenge for Industry 4.0 organizations is the mutual alignment of automation and information technology while increasing effectiveness and agility of processes. From a technological view, it requires architectures and systems coupling heterogeneous technologies, from an operations perspective, it requires contextsensitive representations. Ontologies do not only support alignment, but also integration and development processes. For the introduced ontology we utilize the multi-perspective RAMI4.0 framework, as it provides several layers and perspectives, including production and business processes. We suggest using Subject-oriented Business Process Management (S-BPM) models to represent executable processes, as they allow encapsulating industry standard-conform as well as stakeholder behavior. Thereby, the ontology backs perspective specific knowledge, and can be adapted as semantic baseline in a flexible way.",

      "Abstract": "During the period of digitalization, each company strives to use modern technologies to improve the efficiency of its performance. Maintenance is a big challenge for a transport company. Emergency breakdowns lead to significant financial losses. The main attention in this article was paid to the research on how to build a predictive maintenance system in a railway logistics company. The company under discussion is one of the largest private railway carriers in Russia. The paper presents the stages of forming a system for monitoring the technical condition of vehicles and lists the necessary equipment for each stage. A comparative analysis of the solutions offered on the market was carried out. Based on the results of the analysis, it was decided to use a cloud-based solution. After that, the cost and efficiency of the project were calculated. The implementation of predictive maintenance can significantly reduce costs and improve the quality of the service provided by the company.",

      "Title": "Distributed Reliable and Energy-Efficient Scheduling for LR-WPANs",
      "Abstract": "Pervasiveness of wireless networks drives the heterogeneity and density of devices in a vast diversity of environments. To achieve high reliability and low energy consumption while enabling pervasiveness is inherently a resource allocation problem. In low-rate wireless personal area networks, multi-frequency time-division multiple access methods are identified as compelling solutions to resource allocation via scheduling transmissions in time and frequency. This work presents the TREE (TRaffic-aware Energy Efficient) algorithm, an adaptive and distributed scheduling algorithm, designed to provide high reliability in terms of packet reception ratio while optimizing the energy consumption of each device. This algorithm schedules communications according to the packets in the queue and short-memory performance. Decisions are made locally, and low-interference scheduling emerges at the network level. TREE is an adaptive threshold-based model that allocates more network resources (e.g., timeslots) when the communication queue size crosses a threshold and frees resources if the resource was underutilized. Implemented over IEEE-802.15.4-TSCH and extensively tested in simulation and on real deployments up to 81 devices, the algorithm is compared to MSF, Alice, and Orchestra, the state of the art in time-slotted channel hopping scheduling. Results highlight a high reliability regarding packet reception ratio and a lower energy consumption compared to the state of the art.",

      "Abstract": "In recent years, several countries have created policies to enforce Zero Energy Building (ZEB) standards for new building construction. Achieving this for new buildings is feasible, but it may be difficult to transform existing buildings to ZEBs. Digital twins provide a promising approach to monitor existing buildings and further increase their energy efficiency. A digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a physical entity. It has several applications in product design, product cycle, and fault detection. This paper presents a hybrid approach that combines physics-based and machine learning methods to create a DT for the built environment. A case study for a digital twin of a single room is also discussed. The initial comparison of cooling energy between the physical testbed and the DT model shows promising results for future development. The limitations, challenges, and future development of the approach are also addressed in the paper.",

      "Abstract": "Class imbalance is a major issue when adopting machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model for fault detection of industrial plants in smart factories. In this paper, we propose a data oversampling method termed WASSKIL. WASSKIL is developed based on MAHAKIL that simulates the genetic breeding process, where Wasserstein distance is leveraged rather than Mahalanobis distance when partitioning two sets of data for oversampling. We evaluate the performance of WASSKIL over 5 industrial plants of PHM 2015 dataset, using raw features of sensors and statistical features of the dataset in time series. The results show that WASSKIL can outperform MAHAKIL under both raw features and statistical features. Consequently, our proposed oversampling method has the potential to tame class imbalance, which can be used for prognostics and health management in smart factories.",

      "Abstract": "Manufacturing enterprises are facing the need to align themselves to the new information technologies (IT) and respond to the new challenges of variable market demand. One of the key enablers of this IT revolution toward Smart Manufacturing is the digital twin (DT). It embeds a “virtual” image of the reality constantly synchronized with the real operating scenario to provide sound information (knowledge model) to reality interpretation model to draw sound decisions. The paper aims at providing an up-to date picture of the main DT components, their features and interaction problems. The paper aims at clearly tracing the ongoing research and technical challenges in conceiving and building DTs as well, according to different application domains and related technologies. To this purpose, the main questions answered here are: ‘What is a Digital Twin?’; ‘Where is appropriate to use a Digital Twin?’; ‘When has a Digital Twin to be developed?’; ‘Why should a Digital Twin be used?’; ‘How to design and implement a Digital Twin?’; ‘What are the main challenges of implementing a Digital Twin?’. This study tries to answer to the previous questions funding on a wide systematic literature review of scientific research, tools, and technicalities in different application domains.",

      "Abstract": "The integration of advanced data analytics in manufacturing systems has shown impressive results in various fields, including fault diagnosis, predictive maintenance, energy management, and manufacturing system control. However, due to the distributed nature of analytics algorithms and the growing complexity of modern production systems, the performance and the cost of such systems highly depends on the underlying system architecture. Therefore, it is mandatory that system architects systematically explore and evaluate all architectural alternatives of the highly constrained design space defined by the systems functional and economical objectives. This paper presents a design-space-exploration method that not only generates different implementation alternatives, but also provides a formal performance analysis of the generated solutions. By analyzing the architecture of a manufacturing system as well as the data flow graph model of a data analytics algorithm, we automatically allocate, synthesize, and generate different simulatable software solutions to efficiently compute and visualize data analytics algorithms on the shop floor. This approach allows the user to evaluate different architectural implementation during the design phase, to select a solution according to its requirements and to analyze the performance of the resulting system. The applicability of this method is also demonstrated by means of a real world example.",

      "Abstract": "Optimal maintenance is one of the key concerns for asset-intensive industries in terms of reducing downtime and occurring costs. The advancement of data-driven technologies, affordable computing powers, and growing amounts of data introduced a paradigm with the name of predictive maintenance (PdM). PdM seeks to find out an optimal moment for the maintenance of an asset, where no early intervention leads to undue extra cost, and no late maintenance activity poses a safety risk. With the instrumentation of the cyber-physical system on assets, PdM transforms a typical structure into a smart structure that can send warnings in cases of near failure states. However, several practical challenges hamper the adoption of PdM solutions within industries. This article outlines a typical PdM modeling framework and its key components. Additionally, the adoption challenges, along with alternatives for implementation of the PdM solution are provided. This article concludes by offering several research directions that can accelerate the PdM adoption procedure.",

Therefore, a degradation parameters identification method of the DC-DC power converters is proposed. The main idea of this method is to use a digital twin to build a DC-DC converter. Under steady and transient operating conditions, the power electronic circuits are simulated to deduce the law of output voltage and inductance current variation of the boost and buck converter, and the operation state of the physical entity is estimated. Degradation characteristic parameters, such as capacitance, inductance, parasitic resistance, and MOSFET on-state resistance, are selected and identified based on the Bayesian optimization. The simulation results verify the validity of the method.",

      "Abstract": "Distributed and decentralized power electronics-based rooftop and building integrated photovoltaic (PV) systems are vulnerable to a variety of faults which are difficult to scan and rectify manually. This paper presents design, analysis and experimental validation of online fault remediation strategies in those PV systems. The remediation analysis and design depend not only on a fault type but also on the power conversion architecture of a PV system. The remediation for common failure modes in a typical PV power conversion architecture is proposed. The remediation strategies include minimum additional hardware (e.g. a bypass power semiconductor switch) for power converter switch failures and soft sensors (i.e. digital twin estimators) for electrical sensor failures. To validate these strategies, a laboratory prototype of a 300 W fault-tolerant DC-DC buck-boost converter is built. The converter has a fault-tolerant power stage and it hosts fault diagnosis, prognosis, and reconfigurable control on an FPGA device. The experimental results show significant increase in system output power (thus dependability) after proposed fault remediation is applied amid faulted scenarios such as switch and sensor faults in a distributed power converter.",

Concerns about their use in safety critical areas such as airfield lighting and various other display applications is still far from addressed thanks to the lack of robust methods to determine their remaining useful life (RUL). Though the past literature extensively deals with the problem of life prediction based on reliability analysis and tracking algorithms, there could still be enough scope to find more suitable methods that can be readily implemented on-board the light fixture. Here, we present a method to predict the RUL for high power white LEDs that can be readily implemented on-board the lighting system based on lumen maintenance data and on-board sensor values.",

Especially, the machinery industry significantly benefits from these automation techniques in machine-tool quality inspection, cutting-tool remaining-useful-life, surface roughness prediction, etc. However, these innovation technologies are still not executable in the aerospace-component production due to their complex machining conditions, which result in long metrology delays and severe component deformations. To overcome these two challenges of the aerospace industry, this letter proposes to apply the automatic virtual metrology (AVM) system to successfully convert sampling inspections with metrology delay into real-time and online total inspection and to utilize the so-called deformation fusion (DF) scheme for dealing with the component-deformation problem. The application of the flange operation of aerospace engine-case manufacturing is adopted to illustrate the performance of the AVM-plus-DF approach.",

Harsh environmental conditions require wireless sensor nodes (WSNs) that are robustness and reliable whilst meeting the requirements of miniaturization, functional integrity and energy efficiency at the same time. Moreover design and application of WSNs need to meet the target of an optimized trade-off between direct impacts associated with the life cycle of the electronics as well as indirect impacts triggered through the usage of electronics. In this contribution, functionally equivalent sensor designs are discussed that represent three evolutionary stages of electronics packaging. The most advanced sensor generation presented applies size-optimized routing, embedded active and passive devices and bare-die assembly. The results of a life-cycle based environmental assessment conducted for the three concepts of WSNs are presented. The study allows for the quantification and comparison of environmental impacts associated with the process of miniaturizing cyber physical system hardware by means of advanced packaging.",

      "Abstract": "Transport systems incorporating linear synchronous motors (LSMs) enable linear motion at high speed for emerging factory automation applications. The goal of this work is to determine the feasibility of harvesting energy directly from an operational LSM transport system employed in high volume manufacturing. Microelectromechanical (MEMs) based sensor technology, deployed as part of a wireless cyber physical system (CPS), perform near real-time magnetic field measurement for a mobile LSM vehicle. The vehicle under study is purposed for mobile factory automation and is not wired for communications nor does it have an onboard power source. A series of experiments were designed and conducted to establish the magnetic profile of the system. Empirical data capture was conducted on a cycled LSM test-bed comprising of 2 shuttles and 2 x 3 meter lengths of LSM track (MagneMotion QuickStick®100). Varying vehicle speeds were incorporated in the experimental regime to determine how changes in velocity would impact the magnetic profile of the vehicle. The recorded magnetic field data was analysed and a relationship between LSM vehicle speed and magnetic field frequency was established. The study highlights the potential to employ a single receiving coil to enable energy recovery which in turn could power a cyber-physical system (CPS) tasked with performing condition based monitoring of the LSM transport vehicles. This in turn can form the basis for the development of a predictive maintenance system, deployed to an LSM based transport layer in high volume manufacturing environments.",

      "Abstract": "This article investigates the robust fault prognosis of discrete-event systems (DESs) against the loss of observations of events. To solve this problem, a dilated automaton is generated from the plant by adding an unobservable transition attached to every event subject to loss of observations. We prove the equivalence between the robust prognosability of the plant model and the prognosability of the dilated model. In order to deal with unobservable cycles in the dilated model, a new necessary and sufficient condition of robust prognosability based on diagnoser is presented. Moreover, a polynomial algorithm for the verification of robust prognosability is proposed by constructing the verifier to search the existence of some cycle generated by a faulty trace and an unprognosable trace that run synchronously and keep the identical observation before the fault occurs. Our results generalize previous works on fault prognosis of DESs by taking the loss of observations into account. Note to Practitioners - The research in this article is motivated by the problem of fault prognosis in the manufacturing system. If some information used for prediction is lost, can engineers still make correct decisions about the occurrences of fault? This article aims to investigate the approach of assuring the accuracy and reliability of prediction by introducing the notion of robust prognosis. A polynomial-time algorithm of verifying the robust prognosability is proposed by constructing the tester automaton.",

      "Title": "Structural Health Monitoring and Prognostic of Industrial Plants and Civil Structures: A Sensor to Cloud Architecture",
      "Abstract": "The deployment of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems is a natively interdisciplinary task that involves joint research contributions from sensing technologies, data science and civil engineering. The capability to assess, also from remote stations, the working conditions of industrial plants or the structural integrity of civil buildings is widely requested in many application fields. The technological development aims to continuously provide innovative tools and approaches to satisfy these demands. As a first instance, reliable monitoring strategies are needed to detect structural damages while filtering out environmental noise. Ongoing solutions to tackle these topics are based on the exploitation of highly customized sensing technologies, such as shaped transducers for Acoustic Emission (AE) testing or Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) accelerometers for Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) [1]. On the other hand, effective data acquisition and storage techniques must be employed to cope with the heterogeneity of the sensing devices and with the amount of data produced by collecting raw measured signals. Finally, damage detection and prediction tasks should be computed via data-driven algorithms that can complement the model-based alternatives traditionally used in civil engineering. Layered SHM architectures [2] represent straightforward approaches to address the system complexity originated by this interdisciplinary design; however, few real-world implementations have been presented so far in the literature. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by presenting an Internet of Things (IoT)-based SHM architecture for the predictive maintenance of industrial sites and civil engineering structures and infrastructures. The proposed cyber-physical system includes a monitoring layer, that consists of accelerometer-based sensor networks, a data acquisition layer, built on the recent W3C Web of Things standard [3], and a data storage and analytics layer, which leverages distributed database and Machine Learning tools. We extensively discuss the hardware/software components of the proposed SHM architecture, by stressing its advantages in terms of device versatility, data scalability and interoperability support. Finally, the effectiveness of the system is validated on a real-world use-case, i.e., the monitoring of a metallic frame structure located at the SHM research labs of the University of Bologna, Italy, within the MAC4PRO project [4].",

      "Abstract": "Data management and processing to enable predictive analytics in cyber physical systems holds the promise of creating insight over underlying processes, discovering anomalous behaviours and predicting imminent failures threatening a normal and smooth production process. In this context, proactive strategies can be adopted, as enabled by predictive analytics. Predictive analytics in turn can make a shift in traditional maintenance approaches to more effective optimising their cost and transforming maintenance from a necessary evil to a strategic business factor. Empowered by the aforementioned points, this paper discusses a novel methodology for remaining useful life (RUL) estimation enabling predictive maintenance of industrial equipment using partial knowledge over its degradation function and the parameters that are affecting it. Moreover, the design and prototype implementation of a plug-n-play end-to-end cloud architecture, supporting predictive maintenance of industrial equipment is presented integrating the aforementioned concept as a service. This is achieved by integrating edge gateways, data stores at both the edge and the cloud, and various applications, such as predictive analytics, visualization and scheduling, integrated as services in the cloud system. The proposed approach has been implemented into a prototype and tested in an industrial use case related to the maintenance of a robotic arm. Obtained results show the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed methodology in supporting predictive analytics in the era of Industry 4.0.",

      "Abstract": "It is costly to predict tool wear under various machining conditions. To address this challenge, a tool cyber-physical prediction (TCPP) scheme and a hybrid dynamic neural network (HDNN) model are proposed in this paper. This scheme enables users to build and use the models both in the cloud and at the factory by integrating the theoretical maximum tool life and the practical sensing features of the tool wear. Moreover, using features extracted from the sensors and controller, the HDNN model integrates the logistic regression and dynamic neural network to diagnose the tool break and predict tool wear simultaneously. In addition, the scheme presents a model-refreshing approach to tune the HDNN model to adapt to physical variation of the tool coating, the workpiece material, and the removal process in the similar cutting conditions. The experimental results demonstrate that the TCPP scheme with the HDNN model is promising for tool wear prediction while using only a few samples and the current features to adapt to various cutting conditions.",

      "Title": "A Nonconvex Archetypal Analysis for One-Class Classification Based Anomaly Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems",
      "Abstract": "Data-driven anomaly detection is one of the central issues for the implementation of predictive maintenance in cyber-physical systems (CPS). The increasing nonstationary dynamics in CPS lead to complex shapes of collected process data, e.g., convex and nonconvex. Algorithms with the ability of handling nonconvex data are desired for anomaly detection tasks in CPS. Archetypal analysis selects extreme points (archetypes) to represent a dataset - mainly to improve run times, e.g., for anomaly detection. The classic archetypal analysis uses convex combinations of archetypes to represent a set of observations (data points). This leads to the performance depression of the classic archetypal analysis methods for anomaly detection tasks on nonconvex datasets. Such nonconvex sets are typical for CPS. In this article, the anomaly detection tasks are considered as one-class classification problem due to the lack of abnormal samples. A novel nonconvex archetypal one-class classification algorithm is proposed to address the challenge of nonconvex data, which combines the random projection and the AdaBoost algorithm. The major advantages of this method are its high efficiency, flexibility, and its ability to handle both convex and nonconvex datasets, i.e., it can be applied to CPS analysis tasks. The usefulness of the presented approach is evaluated for fault diagnosis tasks in CPS.",

A data-driven DT is constructed to integrate the physical knowledge of the system and a deep transfer learning model based on stacked denoising autoencoder is used to update the DT with online measurement. A case study with experimental PEMFC degradation data is presented where the proposed data-driven DT prognostics method has applied and reached a high prediction accuracy.

In the CNN-SBULSTM network, CNN is firstly utilized for local feature extraction and dimension reduction. Then SBULSTM network is designed to denoise and encode the temporal information. Finally, multiple fully connected layers are built on the top of the CNN-SBULSTM network to add non-linearity to the output, and one regression layer is utilized to generate the target RUL. The cyber-physical system (CPS) is used to collect the internal controller signals and the external sensor signals during milling process. The proposed hybrid model and several other published methods are applied to the datasets acquired from milling experiments. The comparison and analysis results indicate that the integrated framework is applicable to track the tool wear evolution and predict its RUL with the average prediction accuracy reaching up to 90%.",

      "Abstract": "Condition monitoring of industrial equipment, combined with machine learning algo-rithms, may significantly improve maintenance activities on modern cyber-physical production systems. However, data of proper quality and of adequate quantity, modeling both good operational conditions as well as abnormal situations throughout the operational lifecycle, are required. Nevertheless, this is difficult to acquire in a non-destructive approach. In this context, this study investigates an approach to enable a transition from preventive maintenance activities, that are scheduled at predetermined time intervals, into predictive ones. In order to enable such approaches in a cyber-physical production system, a deep learning algorithm is used, allowing for maintenance activities to be planned according to the actual operational status of the machine and not in advance. An autoencoder-based methodology is employed for classifying real-world machine and sensor data, into a set of condition-related labels. Real-world data collected from manufacturing operations are used for training and testing a prototype implementation of Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders for estimating the remaining useful life of the monitored equipment. Finally, the proposed approach is evaluated in a use case related to a steel industry production process.",

      "Abstract": "This paper introduces an industrial cyber-physical system (CPS) based on the Internet of Things (IoT) that is designed to detect rare events based on machine learning. The framework follows the following three generic steps: (1) Large data acquisition/dissemination: A physical process is monitored by sensors that pre-process the (assumed large) collected data and send the processed information to an intelligent node (e.g., aggregator, central controller); (2) Big data fusion: The intelligent node uses machine learning techniques (e.g., data clustering, neural networks) to convert the received (\"big\") data to useful information to guide short-term operational decisions related to the physical process; (3) Big data analytics: The physical process together with the acquisition and fusion steps can be virtualized, building then a cyber-physical process, whose dynamic performance can be analyzed and optimized through visualization (if human intervention is available) or artificial intelligence (if the decisions are automatic) or a combination thereof. Our proposed general framework, which relies on an IoT network, aims at an ultra-reliable detection/prevention of rare events related to a pre-determined industrial physical process (modelled by a particular signal). The framework will be process-independent, however, our demonstrated solution will be designed case-by-case. This paper is an introduction to the solution to be developed by the FIREMAN consortium.",

      "Abstract": "The automated conveyor system, as the core component in the modern manufacturing world, has gained lots of attention from researchers. To optimize the operation of the conveyor system, range-inspection control (RIC) has been considered an efficient strategy to bring this conventional technology to an intelligent level. Various algorithms have been put into use to achieve optimal control. However, the current methodologies are only focusing on control optimization, not scaled into the smart manufacturing framework. The schema of alignment and corporation between the physical and virtual spaces for the system remains an important problem. Therefore, the work in this article aims for an effective framework of implementation between the physical and virtual stations in an automated conveyor system. Since increasingly more application scenarios rely on the digital twin (DT) technology to realize the integration of physical and virtual systems, we proposed the DT automated conveyor system (DT-ACS) that constructs the road map to implement the RIC-based conveyor system under the background of a smart factory. Besides, profit-sharing-based deep Q-networks (PDQNs) have been proposed to cope with the RIC optimization problem. The robustness and efficiency of the proposed PDQN were evaluated via sets of experiments. The discussion and conclusion are presented at last accordingly. Note to Practitioners - This article aims to propose a strategy of control optimization for conveyor-based manufacturing systems under the digital twin (DT) framework. The conveyor system can be flexible to control the running flows to avoid overloading workstations. Due to the complex environment in the production line, the range that is able to be inspected and the capacity of the reserve area can be considerably diverse among the workstations. To maximally evaluate our framework, we set a comparatively complex environment for the experiments. Nevertheless, to obtain practically ideal performance under other circumstances, the parameters should be precisely tested and fine-tuned with simulation in advance.",

      "Title": "A diagnosis-prognosis feedback loop for improved performance under uncertainties",
      "Abstract": "The feed-forward relationship between diagnosis and prognosis is the foundation of both aircraft structural health management and the digital twin concept. Measurements of structural response are obtained either in-situ with mounted sensor networks or offline using more traditional techniques (e.g., nondestructive evaluation). Diagnosis algorithms process this information to detect and quantify damage and then feed this data forward to a prognostic framework. A prognosis of the structure’s future operational readiness (e.g., remaining useful life or residual strength) is then made and is used to inform mission-critical decision-making. Years of research have been devoted to improving the elements of this process, but the process itself has not changed significantly. Here, a new approach is proposed in which prognosis information is not only fed forward for decision-making, but it is also fed back to the forthcoming diagnosis. In this way, diagnosis algorithms can take advantage of a priori information about the expected state of health, rather than operating in an uninformed condition. As a feasibility test, a diagnosis-prognosis feedback loop of this manner is demonstrated. The approach is applied to a numerical example in which fatigue crack growth is simulated in a simple aluminum alloy test specimen. A prognosis was derived from a set of diagnoses which provided feedback to a subsequent set of diagnoses. Improvements in accuracy and a reduction in uncertainty in the prognosis-informed diagnoses were observed when compared with an uninformed diagnostic approach.",

      "Abstract": "This paper proposes a Digital Twin approach for health monitoring. In this approach, a Digital Twin model based on nonparametric Bayesian network is constructed to denote the dynamic degradation process of health state and the propagation of epistemic uncertainty. Then, a real-time model updating strategy based on improved Gaussian particle filter (GPF) and Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM) is presented to enhance the model adaptability. On one hand, for those parameters in the nonparametric Bayesian network with prior models, the improved GPF is used to update them in real time. On the other hand, for parameters lacking a prior model, DPMM is proposed to learn hidden variables, which adaptively update the model structure and greatly reduce uncertainty. Experiments on the electro-optical system are conducted to validate the feasibility of the Digital Twin approach and verify the effectiveness of the nonparametric Bayesian network. The results of comparative experiments prove that the Digital Twin approach based on nonparametric Bayesian Network has a good model self-learning ability, which improves the accuracy of health monitoring.",

      "Abstract": "Predictive maintenance (PdM) for smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0 has been associated with manufacturing intelligence supported by Artificial Intelligence (AI). Therefore, PdM also relies on the smart manufacturing technologies including cyber-physical system (CPS) and big data analytics. The multi-agent system (MAS) technology and deep learning (DL) have shown the capacity to provide efficient tools for the implementation of PdM in a CPS enabled smart industrial production system gaining feedback from big data analytics. Induction motors (IM) constitute the main power source in the industrial production environment and therefore their maintenance and early fault detection and diagnosis (FD/D) is a critical process. Neural network (NN) based FD/D of IM has been widely used in order to identify different fault types. DL methods have recently emerged for FD/D of IM and can efficiently analyze massive data coming from different machine sensors. The MAS has recently been used in combination with artificial NNs as a decision support tool for FD/D of IM. This paper aims to provide a review of recent trends in PdM of IM focusing on MAS and DL based FD/D methods that have emerged in the last 5 years due to their potential to be implemented in a smart manufacturing system. A discussion of the presented methods is given in order to present the recent developments and trends and provide future directions for research.",

      "Abstract": "Manufacturing systems are making a shift towards intelligent and predictive Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) with enhanced sensing and communication capabilities. Current maintenance activities are based on predefined schedules, without considering the working state of the equipment and thus leading to over-maintained machinery. The cost related to the production process interruption and for dispatching maintenance personnel to restore the equipment to proper working conditions is high. In this context, this study presents an extendable and re-usable scheduling approach supporting multiple heterogeneous inputs and outputs. Predictive maintenance indicators from the monitored equipment are used for scheduling maintenance operations in line with the existing schedule. A web-service architecture is adopted towards supporting highly different use-cases, such as equipment providers and/or manufacturers. The incorporation of maintenance activities to the production schedule may result in a reduction of maintenance breakdowns and thus increased productivity.

      "Title": "A Digital-Twin-Assisted Fault Diagnosis Using Deep Transfer Learning",
      "Abstract": "Digital twin is a significant way to achieve smart manufacturing, and provides a new paradigm for fault diagnosis. Traditional data-based fault diagnosis methods mostly assume that the training data and test data are following the same distribution and can acquire sufficient data to train a reliable diagnosis model, which is unrealistic in the dynamic changing production process. In this paper, we present a two-phase digital-twin-assisted fault diagnosis method using deep transfer learning (DFDD), which realizes fault diagnosis both in the development and maintenance phases. At first, the potential problems that are not considered at design time can be discovered through front running the ultra-high-fidelity model in the virtual space, while a deep neural network (DNN)-based diagnosis model will be fully trained. In the second phase, the previously trained diagnosis model can be migrated from the virtual space to physical space using deep transfer learning for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance. This ensures the accuracy of the diagnosis as well as avoids wasting time and knowledge. A case study about fault diagnosis using DFDD in a car body-side production line is presented. The results show the superiority and feasibility of our proposed method.",

Product-service system is a concept that provides self-aware and self-learning machines, and consequently improve overall performance and maintenance management. Companies continually strive to increase production, but in recent years, the effects of this effort have demonstrated that provision of products alone with less resilient technology-enabled service industry is insufficient to remain competitive. The importance of leveraging flexibility and capabilities offered by cloud computing is inevitable, but adapting prognostics and health management algorithms to efficiently implement current data management technologies was research and develop in this study. In this paper, we present an integrated product-service system as a potential concept from a life-cycle perspective to reduce disruption, costs and associated services such as autonomous maintenance, through exchange of data to understand equipment degradation using sensors application, to aid timely services intervention for manufacturing processes transformation. The results is the knowledge base servitude backed by machine clusters generated data for different working conditions to improve operational efficiency using Cloud IoT to connect, process, store, and analyse data on the dashboard, locally and in the cloud for future health assessment.",

      "Title": "A Domain Adaptive Convolutional LSTM Model for Prognostic Remaining Useful Life Estimation under Variant Conditions",
      "Abstract": "In the age of industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing, a large volume of sensor data is produced from cyber-physical systems (CPS) and prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) of a machine or system becomes crucial for prognostics and health management (PHM). Several linear regression and deep learning models have been studied to extract features from segmented time windows and learn the degradation patterns. However, distributions of features are varying between source learning domain and target test domains, due to different working conditions and environments. Thus, the generalization of traditional methods will be influenced, which leads to performance degradation. This paper develops a domain adaptive CNN-LSTM (DACL) model to predict the RUL of a system based on the multi-dimensional sensor data. The DACL model combines the CNN and LSTM with domain adaptive transfer mechanism and takes the operating conditions into consideration. The features extracted by CNN of both source and target data are transformed to a higher dimensional space by reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and the loss function is compensated by using maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to reduce the distributions discrepancy. The model is evaluated on C-MAPSS dataset and demonstrate its performance improvement by comparing with previous methods.",

      "Title": "A Dynamic Data Driven Applications Systems (DDDAS)-Based Digital Twin IoT Framework",
      "Abstract": "One of the key elements of DDDAS is the ability to create a feedback control loop from the sensory system to the model to enable more accurate and fast data-driven analysis. When constructing such a framework, it is especially important to provide an efficient, filtered data stream to the model. To address this need, this investigation describes a DDDAS-based Digital Twin IoT Framework which comprises three layers, namely the Edge, Fog and Cloud. The Edge is composed of either commercial sensing data acquisition systems or by sensors without any commercial system being involved. The Edge layer is connected to the Fog which is a decentralized computing layer that consists of an in-house built Internet of Things (IoT) device. Within the Fog, real-time data is aggregated, parsed, filtered, and passed through a layer of user-defined algorithms. These algorithms can be either predefined or made using an interactive algorithm building application. The main goal of the algorithms used at the Fog, is to reduce the incoming data and classify it into known classes. This process allows a real-time data flow to the Cloud, as only important decision-making components of the data is propagated. The algorithms are trained in the Cloud layer using historic data to enable stronger confidence in Prognostics and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) calculations. The Cloud is also responsible for hosting a user interface (UI) to interact with the Edge and Fog Layers and the Digital Twin model. The UI enables users to start, stop, and modify their data acquisition and visualize their analytics in (near) real-time. In the proposed study, sensing data obtained through mechanical testing using a carbon composite will be leveraged for the framework. Diagnostics and Prognostics leveraging a probability framework will be conducted on the sensor data.",

      "Title": "A fog computing approach for predictive maintenance",
      "Abstract": "Technological advances in areas such as communications, computer processing, connectivity, data management are gradually introducing the internet of things (IoT) paradigm across companies of different domain. In this context and as systems are making a shift into cyber-physical system of systems, connected devices provide massive data, that are usually streamed to a central node for further processing. In particular and related to the manufacturing domain, Data processing can provide insight in the operational condition of the organization or process monitored. However, there are near real time constraints for such insights to be generated and data-driven decision making to be enabled. In the context of internet of things for smart manufacturing and empowered by the aforementioned, this study discusses a fog computing paradigm for enabling maintenance related predictive analytic in a manufacturing environment through a two step approach: (1) Model training on the cloud, (2) Model execution on the edge. The proposed approach has been applied to a use case coming from the robotic industry.",

      "Title": "A framework to help decision makers to be environmentally aware during the maintenance of cyber physical systems",
      "Abstract": "For decades, maintenance of facilities and equipment, as well as related activities (from fault detection to prognostics and health management), has a proven impact on efficiency of production systems and is thus still the subject of numerous developments (from corrective to proactive maintenance). These developments are supported by the increase in digital pervasiveness accompanying the Industry 4.0. concept, based in particular on the use of Cyber-Physical Systems. In addition, we are witnessing the growing interest of the political and academic world and public opinion with regard to the sustainable impact of human activity. For company decision-makers, triple bottom line accounting frameworks have been introduced at higher decision levels (strategic) based on economic, social, and environmental performance indicators. This triple preoccupation has not yet been integrated into studies on middle (tactical) and lower (operational) decision levels, and paradoxically, not into production facility health management either. In this paper, we propose the deployment of a framework helping decisions makers to be environmentally aware in the maintenance of cyber physical systems. This framework consists of three key elements: a new maintenance policy called Sustainable Condition-Based Maintenance (SCBM), which requires the assessment of the Remaining Sustainable Life (RSL) as a key indicator; an adaptation and extension of a generic prognostic business process initially proposed for traditional Conditions Based Maintenance (CBM); and an organization adapted to the prognosis of the environmental performance of systems, based on holonic structures. We present the implementation of such a framework on a real Cyber Physical Systems under development.",

      "Abstract": "The capability to predict the behaviour of machines is nowadays experiencing a tremendous growth of interest within Industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems. The route to this end is not straightforward when Run-To-Failure (RTF) data are poorly available or not available at all, thus a strategy must be properly defined. In this proposal, assuming no RTF data, a novelty detection is combined with random coefficient statistical modelling for Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction. This approach is formalized by means of a reference framework extending the ISO 13374–OSA-CBM standards. The framework guides the integration of novelty detection and RUL prediction finally implemented in the scope of a Flexible Manufacturing Line part of the Industry 4.0 Lab of the School of Management of Politecnico di Milano.",

      "Abstract": "The field of prognostic maintenance aims at predicting the remaining time for a system or component to continue being used under the desired performance. This time is usually named as Remaining Useful Life (RUL). The current study proposes a novel approach for the RUL estimation of coating segments placed on a hot rolling mill machine. A prediction method was developed, providing real-time updates of the RUL prediction during the rolling milling process. The proposed approach performs energy analysis on measurements of segment surface temperatures and hydraulic forces. It uses nonparametric statistical processes to update the predictions, within a prediction horizon/window, indicating the number of remaining products to be processed. To assess the probability of failure within the defined prediction window, Maximum Likelihood Estimation is used. The proposed methodology was implemented in a software prototype in the MATLAB environment and tested in an industrial use case coming from a steel parts manufacturer, facilitating testing and validation of the suggested approach. Real-world data were acquired from the operational machine, while the validation results support that the proposed methodology demonstrates reasonable performance and robustness against product type variations.",

      "Abstract": "As industry heads to an era of high productivity and energy efficiency, the manufacturing of robotic manipulators moves far from the traditionally heavy and stiff structures. Therefore, rigid body dynamic models become obsolete and the need for new dynamic models accounting for the flexibility of industrial manipulators emerges. To this end, a physics-based approach considering the flexibility of robots' links and gearboxes is presented. In particular, this paper intends to provide a framework for modelling flexible robotic structures' towards increasing their accuracy. The robot components' elasticity is introduced in a lumped parameters model by pairs of springs and dampers, the number of which is affected by the target of keeping the computational effort and run time of the simulation at levels allowing for the integration of the model in industrial environments. Finally, the proposed model considers the activation of the robots' Digital Twins aiming to enable the use of the model in a series of applications e.g. predictive maintenance, energy efficiency optimization etc.",

      "Abstract": "The increasing demand of using automated algorithms for fault diagnosis and health assessment in current industry is undeniable. Consequently, implementing emerging technologies such as cyber physical systems, cloud computing in prognostics and health management algorithms is inevitable. Due to these improvements and the emerging Big Data environment, optimizing algorithms for consuming less process and network bandwidth but generating high accuracy is important. Considering these factors, in this research, we propose a generic fault diagnosis framework for rotating machineries with variant methods and parameters for different steps of the algorithm. Methods, such as Fast Fourier Transform and Wavelet Transform for signal processing and Artificial Neural Networks and K-Nearest Neighbor for fault classification are considered in this study. This framework is applied to a gearbox and bearing system in order to evaluate the effect of simplicity in the overall performance of prognostic and health management algorithms. Finally, results of this paper shows that precise selection of methods and parameters will eliminate the requirement of using more complex and computationally expensive methods.",

Still, com-panies experience hardship when transforming from reactive to predictive manufacturing systems. The latter, driven by data science development, use predictive models to detect and solve production and maintenance issues before they happen. To eliminate the need for large and varied datasets for development of predictive models, in the present research we propose development of real-time predictive models based on small dataset without faulty data. This is achieved by using Mahalanobis-Taguchi system for fault detection in lack of fault data samples, and by using Edge Computing environment which provides higher re-sponsiveness, better security and decreased costs. Subsequently, two predictive models are developed, tested and compared for the case company from process industry (i.e. the vi-nyl-floor industry sector). Finally, recommendations for the industry are provided.",

      "Abstract": "The integration of advanced data analytics in manufacturing systems has shown impressive results in various fields, including fault diagnosis, predictive maintenance, energy management, and manufacturing system control. However, due to the distributed nature of analytics algorithms and the growing complexity of modern production systems, the performance and the cost of such systems highly depends on the underlying system architecture. Therefore, it is mandatory that system architects systematically explore and evaluate all architectural alternatives of the highly constrained design space defined by the systems functional and economical objectives. This paper presents a design-space-exploration method that not only generates different implementation alternatives, but also provides a formal performance analysis of the generated solutions. By analyzing the architecture of a manufacturing system as well as the data flow graph model of a data analytics algorithm, we automatically allocate, synthesize, and generate different simulatable software solutions to efficiently compute and visualize data analytics algorithms on the shop floor. This approach allows the user to evaluate different architectural implementation during the design phase, to select a solution according to its requirements and to analyze the performance of the resulting system. The applicability of this method is also demonstrated by means of a real world example.",

A distribution subsystem comprises a CPS (Cyber Physical System) where the Cyber part is enabled by a low latency IIoT network and computational resources at the edge (distribution grid subsystem controller) while the physical system is represented (Digital Twin) by a hybrid model of the grid: a data driven machine learning representation of a limited number of nodes, along with a discrete-time model-based transient state estimator which captures the near real time physical operation of the grid. In case of early warning measurements acquired through the IIoT, machine learning edge computations can detect the severity of the warning, identify the network area of interest while ignite the execution of the transient state estimation. The transient state estimation predicts the incoming failure in near real time while the timing window allows possible preventive actuation.",

Fault of CNCMT might cause the loss of precision and affect the production if troubleshooting is not timely. Therefore, the reliability of CNCMT has a big significance. Predictive maintenance is an effective method to avoid faults and casualties. Due to less consideration of the status variety and consistency of CNCMT in its life cycle, current methods cannot achieve accurate, timely and intelligent results. To realize reliable predictive maintenance of CNCMT, a hybrid approach driven by Digital Twin (DT) is studied. This approach is DT model-based and DT data-driven hybrid. With the proposed framework, a hybrid predictive maintenance algorithm based on DT model and DT data is researched. At last, a case study on cutting tool life prediction is conducted. The result shows that the proposed method is feasible and more accurate than single approach.",

Predictive simulation models help engineers and operators increase their understanding of systems in a cost-effective and repeatable environment by offering Situational Intelligence & Automation.This paper will include the benefits of adding such a system, the challenges that must be overcome and the lessons that have been learned from the implementation of several of these systems. It will also serve as a handbook on justification for a model-driven power management and automation of oil and gas facilities.",

      "Title": "Study of packaging and installation of FBG sensors for monitoring of aircraft systems",
      "Abstract": "Next generation aircraft systems will feature an ever increasing complexity. In this context, advanced health monitoring strategies will be required to ensure a high level of operations safety as well as a good reliability. Hence, Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) is emerging as an enabling discipline for future advanced aircraft design and operations, with a particular application to Flight Control System (FCS) monitoring. One of the most critical issues for real-time Fault Detection and Identification (FDI) of aircraft FCS is the availability of actuator load measurements. The aerodynamic load on flight control actuators has a significant influence on their dynamic response, and can easily hide the effect of incipient failure precursors. For this reason, real-time monitoring FDI algorithms relying on the comparison between the actual system response and that of a digital twin require either a measure or an estimation of aerodynamic loads. Usually, this quantity is not monitored by a dedicated sensor, since it is not required as a feedback signal by most control logics. A dedicated load sensor for PHM with traditional technologies is not easily feasible: for example, a load cell would be mechanically connected in series with the actuator, adding a potential single failure point and affecting the overall system safety; the use of strain gages on the structure is less accurate, and requires several sensors with individual wiring and complex signal conditioning circuitry. Optical strain sensors based on Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBG) allow indirect load measurement combined with real-time structural monitoring, combining an acceptable increase in complexity and costs with a high robustness. In this preliminary study, we installed an FBG monitoring system on a UAV to assess the feasibility of such technology. Measures of structure deflection were correlated to actuator position and IMU data, to estimate aerodynamic loads.",

      "Abstract": "Monitoring and Modeling of a Wind Turbine Support Structure to Create a Digital Twin. The basis for creating a digital twin is a suitable model with a close connection to reality in the form of measurement data. In this paper it is explained how model and measurement data of the support structure of a wind turbine can be obtained. The procedure is implemented on a real wind turbine with a concrete/steel hybrid tower. The monitoring includes the acquisition of vibrations, strains and temperature as well as the determination of the dynamic Young's modulus of the concrete structure by sound velocity measurements. For modeling, a finite element model with shell elements was chosen, which takes into account stiffening effects from static loads. A comparison between model and reality is the most important premise for the use of a digital twin: Therefore, a multi-stage model validation based on modal parameters and local material stresses is performed. The Digital Twin offers different usage scenarios; here one is carried out: the fatigue calculation and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. For this purpose, material stresses at highly stressed positions are determined using measurement data and model. The results are currently still unrealistically high lifetimes for the concrete part. The results are based on relatively short (1 h, 24 h) stress time series. This could be one reason for the high values. It could also be an indication that fatigue is a non-critical load case for the concrete part.",

      "Title": "Mapping data sets to concepts using machine learning and a knowledge based approach",
      "Abstract": "Machine learning techniques have a huge potential to take some tasks of humans, e.g. anomaly detection or predictive maintenance, and thus support operators of cyber physical systems (CPSs). One challenge is to communicate algorithms results to machines or humans, because they are on a sub-symbolical level and thus hard to interpret. To simplify the communication and thereby the usage of the results, they have to be transferred to a symbolic representation. Today, the transformation is typically static which does not satisfy the needs for fast changing CPSs and prohibit the usage of the full machine learning potential. This work introduces a knowledge based approach of an automatic mapping between the sub-symbolic results of algorithms and their symbolic representation. Clustering is used to detect groups of similar data points which are interpreted as concepts. The information of clusters are extracted and further classified with the help of an ontology which infers the current operational state. Data from wind turbines is used to evaluate the approach. The achieved results are promising, the system can identify its operational state without an explicit mapping.",

      "Title": "Prognostic health management of production systems. New proposed approach and experimental evidences",
      "Abstract": "Prognostic Health Management (PHM) is a maintenance policy aimed at predicting the occurrence of a failure in components and consequently minimizing unexpected downtimes of complex systems. Recent developments in condition monitoring (CM) techniques and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools enabled the collection of a huge amount of data in real-time and its transformation into meaningful information that will support the maintenance decision-making process. The emerging Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) technologies connect distributed physical systems with their virtual representations in the cyber computational world. The PHM assumes a key role in the implementation of CPS in manufacturing contexts, since it allows to keep CPS and its machines in proper conditions. On the other hand, CPS-based PHM provide an efficient solution to maximize availability of machines and production systems. In this paper, evolving and unsupervised approaches for the implementation of PHM at a component level are described, which are able to process streaming data in real-time and with almost-zero prior knowledge about the monitored component. A case study from a real industrial context is presented. Different unsupervised and online anomaly detection methods are combined with evolving clustering models in order to detect anomalous behaviours in streaming vibration data and integrate the so-generated knowledge into supervised and adaptive models; then, the degradation model for each identified fault is built and the resulting RUL prediction model integrated into the online analysis. Supervised methods are applied to the same dataset, in batch mode, to validate the proposed procedure.",

Since in this environment, massive amounts of data have been generated and collected, integration and management of various data sources is of paramount importance. In this context, cloud computing as a crucial part of Industry 4.0 facilitates distribution of computer resources without direct active management by users. Accordingly, an ontology enables efficient integration and management of data as a reference data model through representation of knowledge. Besides, data mining from massive data is very important to identify significant meaning of data, and to avoid unexpected errors through predictions from experiences described in data replica. This research addresses problems towards efficient integration and management of data for predictive maintenance.",

      "Abstract": "The fourth industrial revolution-the so called Industry 4.0 strategy-fosters to provide devices/assets/machines at industrial plants with a reliable connectivity, by means of the use of innovative technologies such as Cyber Physical Systems, Internet of Things, Cloud and Big Data services. Energy consumption monitoring in manufacturing plants provides useful information to save energy while reducing CO2 emissions, but also for predictive maintenance or process optimization applications what results in costs reduction. This paper describes an Open-IoT solution to measure energy consumption in factories that reveal in detail the use of energy at each industrial machine and the energy consumed to perform a particular industrial process. This solution, based on BatNET wireless communication technology, has been installed worldwide at 16 factories dedicated to the manufacture of steel and aluminum parts for the automotive industry. BatNET is built on open and standard protocols and it was initially envisaged for building and Smart City applications. Some adaptations in hardware, firmware and software have been required to fulfil the industrial harsh environment. The implementation issues faced when installing this Industrial IoT system in real environments are presented in this paper. Special attention has been paid to the constraints motivated by factory requirements and embedded processing and data storage capabilities, as well as their solutions and the final results.",

      "Title": "A smart process controller framework for Industry 4.0 settings",
      "Abstract": "This paper presents a smart supervisory framework for a single process controller, designed for Industry 4.0 shop floors. This digitization of a full supervisory suite for a single process controller enables self-awareness, self-diagnosis, self-prognosis, and self-healing (by definition, these \"self\" elements are missing from other supervisory frameworks diagnosing numerous controllers in parallel). The proposed framework is aligned with the concept of a Cyber Physical System (CPS), since its implementation generates a rich cyber physical entity of the controlled process. This CPS entity can either be considered as the process digital twin, or can provide a solid basis for generating it. Finally, the framework includes the main characteristics of Industry 4.0, such as advanced use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data analysis. The framework is based on four modules: (1) Control and Awareness module—performing both continuous process control and adjustments, as well as machine learning (ML) and statistical process control (SPC) for identifying abnormalities that require further diagnosis; (2) Process -diagnosis module—performing continual (recurrent) analysis of the process state and trends; (3) Prognosis and Healing module—performing prognosis and automated intervention via parameter changes, re-configurations, and automated maintenance; (4) External Interaction Platform—an interactive module for interfacing with experts, presenting them with the process analysis information and obtaining feedback from them as part of a learning process. Using an implementation showcase to illustrate the methodological framework’s applicability, we demonstrate its real-world potential. The proposed framework could serve as a guide for implementing smart process control and maintenance systems in Industry 4.0 shop floors. It could also provide a firm basis for comparison with future suggested frameworks. Future research directions could include pursuing improvements to the proposed process control framework and validating the framework by case studies of its implementation.",

      "Abstract": "This article illustrates a systematic approach for predicting tool wear in machining process through Cyber-Physical System (CPS) architecture using simple electronic components such as personal computers and low-cost sensors. The proposed Cyber-Physical structure consists of 5 steps; smart connection, data to information, feature extraction, awareness of issues and self-adjustment. We tried to install a big data analysis technology into CPS architecture to catch the usual/unusual state of the cutting tool from the spindle power consumption changes. The excessive repetitions of grooving would bring the trend changing of power consumption. To facilitate the statistical analysis, the correlation coefficient R was calculated from the single regression analysis between two different cycles of time-series power consumption. The correlation coefficient R also had a strong relation with the condition changes of tool wear and would become a powerful tool to catch the usual/unusual state of the cutting tool in the proposed CPS architecture. The health information obtained from the system can be used for higher level of management of cutting tool based on the condition monitoring free from the schedule-based maintenance.",

      "Abstract": "Predictive maintenance plays an important role in modern Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) and data-driven methods have been a worthwhile direction for Prognostics Health Management (PHM). However, two main challenges have significant influences on the traditional fault diagnostic models: one is that extracting hand-crafted features from multi-dimensional sensors with internal dependencies depends too much on expertise knowledge; the other is that imbalance pervasively exists among faulty and normal samples. As deep learning models have proved to be good methods for automatic feature extraction, the objective of this paper is to study an optimized deep learning model for imbalanced fault diagnosis for CPSs. Thus, this paper proposes a weighted Long Recurrent Convolutional LSTM model with sampling policy (wLRCL-D) to deal with these challenges. The model consists of 2-layer CNNs, 2-layer inner LSTMs and 2-Layer outer LSTMs, with under-sampling policy and weighted cost-sensitive loss function. Experiments are conducted on PHM 2015 challenge datasets, and the results show that wLRCL-D outperforms other baseline methods.",

      "Abstract": "In Smart Manufacturing, the Internet of Things technology brings about new possibilities as for the interaction of Cyber-Physical Systems with their virtual models- in Industry 4.0 jargon, Digital Twins. Besides traditional roles in engineering and control design, Digital Twins cab play innovative ones by evolving together with their cyber-physical counterpart: predictive maintenance, fault detection, or fast training of data-based decision aid tools. In this paper we focus on the relevance of dynamic models in this scenario, particularly as for the co-existence of continuous-time and discrete-event models wherever control and planning are involved. We argue that in such cases, models with analysis-specific levels of detail have to co-exist, interact and maintain mutual consistency. We propose a modelling approach to address the problem, and present a supporting example based on an object-oriented modelling language.",

      "Abstract": "Predictive maintenance is a strategic activity in the context of Industry 4.0 in order to maintain a certain level of quality production and to avoid unexpected equipment downtimes. In this scenario, the analysis of IIOT data is necessary to achieve prediction on the future machinery' status. The proposed approach relies on the use of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) techniques mapped from electronic domain to production line domain. These EDA techniques are combined with field knowledge, especially for Predictive Maintenance analysis. This presentation describes a methodology that allows to abstract raw data retrieved from IIOT sensors into a class of severity levels, core of the proposed methodology. For example, a class of severity level is reported in the ISO 10816 standard for vibration measurement, but similar concepts are proposed for other values. The methodology consists of two phases: first of all, traces of the nominal behavior are stored to be reused, then, such raw data are filtered with the nominal behavior and translated into severity levels. Such levels are then embedded into IIoT edge devices through the synthesis of the so-called Predictive Maintenance State Machines. The methodology has been validated on the model of a mechanical transmission system. Furthermore, the correctness of the strategy has been proved by injecting faults on the original model and by exploiting simulation procedures under different operational scenarios. This methodology gives to IIoT sensors their specific role in the software automation pyramid, by abstracting their data into levels used through the formalism of Predictive Maintenance State Machines (PMSM).",

In this context, Predictive Maintenance is part of the process and it requires accurate operating information gathered from various sources including particularly instrumentation health. To achieve this, the development of a fieldbus architecture for the acquisition of specific smart instrumentation data is presented. The challenge is to preserve the main 4-20mA current loop from any functional disruption and interruption of service as these valves are already deployed and connected to Programmable Logic Controller using standard 4-20mA current loop. To solve such a challenge, validation tests on a representative platform are presented to verify that there is no impact on the existing control flow.",

      "Abstract": "Constructing an effective architecture based on digital twins using advanced artificial intelligent technologies remains a key challenge in smart power distribution system. Despite recent advances in important domains such as device health maintenance and manufacturing process, the conventional architecture does not offer a satisfactory solution for rapidly providing data models, a set of analytics or algorithms, and knowledge. In this work, we employ ideas from distributed network based on digital twins and from recent advances that augment artificial intelligent with big data. Our architecture provides a paradigm that uses a distributed network makes computer programming, software, and data spread out across more than one terminal, but communicate complex messages through terminal nodes, and are dependent upon each other, obviating the pressure from master station. We demonstrate the usefulness of digital twins that are used to track the performance of devices such as transformer during normal operation to detect possible defects and fix them before they result in failure. We also conclude that using digital twin technology will understand, predict, and optimize performance in order to achieve improved business outcomes, and apply machine learning and knowledge to predict the future.",

      "Abstract": "The remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of industrial cyber-physical system components demands the use of reliable prognostics parameters and frameworks. Against the traditional use of a single measure of degradation, data from multiple sensors provide abundant characteristic information for modeling, assessing, and extracting useful parameters via appropriate signal processing and sensor fusion methods. This study introduces a multi-sensor prognostics approach which merges highly prognosible statistical features from vibrational and pressure sensor measurements after a multi-level wavelet decomposition of the signals. The prognostic algorithm presented in this work for solenoid pump RUL prediction is a multi-objective genetic algorithm-optimized long short-term memory (MOGA-LSTM) which accepts the fused sensor features as input and returns the RUL of the pump as output. The framework was tested on a run-to-failure experiment on a VSC63A5 Solenoid pump following a significant pump malfunction caused by a clogged suction filter after the test. Using standard prognostic performance evaluation metrics, the performance of the prognostics framework was compared with other reliable state-of-the-art methods with a remarkable comparative advantage in addition to better automation potentials for real-time condition monitoring and RUL prediction.",

      "Abstract": "The design philosophy for airframe safety has experienced evolution from static strength, safety life, damage tolerance and durability, to individual aircraft tracking, with a trend towards the airframe digital twin in the future. The airframe twin driven by the digital thread is a multidisciplinary, multi-physical, multi-scale, multi-fidelity, and multi-uncertainty virtual simulation system. It uses multi-source data such as online sensor monitoring, offline ground inspection, and aircraft operation history to reflect and predict the behavior and performance of the corresponding airframe physical entity during the entire lifespan. It is expected to reform the existing paradigm of airframe usage and maintenance. Focusing on fatigue life management, this study proposes five key modeling and simulation technologies, which are (a) acquisition of load and damage data, (b) multi-scale mechanical modeling of airframes, (c) high-performance simulation of damage development, (d) efficient digital twin construction based on Reduced Order Modeling (ROM), (e) Remaining Useful Life (RUL) assessment considering multi-source uncertainty and heterogeneous data. This article discusses the state of the art of the proposed five key technologies as well as future research directions, providing reference for the systematic study and engineering applications of the airframe digital twin.",

      "Title": "Recent Developments towards Industry 4.0 Oriented Predictive Maintenance in Induction Motors",
      "Abstract": "Predictive maintenance (PdM) for smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0 has been associated with manufacturing intelligence supported by Artificial Intelligence (AI). Therefore, PdM also relies on the smart manufacturing technologies including cyber-physical system (CPS) and big data analytics. The multi-agent system (MAS) technology and deep learning (DL) have shown the capacity to provide efficient tools for the implementation of PdM in a CPS enabled smart industrial production system gaining feedback from big data analytics. Induction motors (IM) constitute the main power source in the industrial production environment and therefore their maintenance and early fault detection and diagnosis (FD/D) is a critical process. Neural network (NN) based FD/D of IM has been widely used in order to identify different fault types. DL methods have recently emerged for FD/D of IM and can efficiently analyze massive data coming from different machine sensors. The MAS has recently been used in combination with artificial NNs as a decision support tool for FD/D of IM. This paper aims to provide a review of recent trends in PdM of IM focusing on MAS and DL based FD/D methods that have emerged in the last 5 years due to their potential to be implemented in a smart manufacturing system. A discussion of the presented methods is given in order to present the recent developments and trends and provide future directions for research.",

      "Abstract": "This paper is concerned with the implementation and field-testing of an edge device for real-time condition monitoring and fault detection for large-scale rotating equipment in the UK water industry. The edge device implements a local digital twin, processing information from low-cost transducers mounted on the equipment in real-time. Condition monitoring is achieved with sliding-mode observers employed as soft sensors to estimate critical internal pump parameters to help detect equipment weasr before damage occurs. The paper describes the implementation of the edge system on a prototype microcontroller-based embedded platform, which supports the Modbus protocol; IP/GSM communication gateways provide remote connectivity to the network core, allowing further detailed analytics for predictive maintenance to take place. The paper first describes validation testing of the edge device using Hardware-In-The-Loop techniques, followed by trials on large-scale pumping equipment in the field. The paper concludes that the proposed system potentially delivers a flexible and low-cost industrial digitalization platform for condition monitoring and predictive maintenance applications in the water industry.",

      "Abstract": "Dry-type transformers are rapidly becoming popular as wind turbine step-up (WTSU) transformers, especially in offshore wind farms. Cast resin transformers are not flammable and are also resistant to moisture. However, their thermalelectrical degradation must be carefully analysed given the special conditions of wind farm installations. The present paper studies the remaining useful life (RUL) calculation of dry-type WTSU transformers based on the most thermally stressed location i.e. the winding hot-spot. The estimation of the loss of life of the transformer can be used for diagnostic and prognostic monitoring purposes in the framework of digital twins. The methodology is then applied to a typical WTSU load profile and the impact of several transformer characteristics and operating conditions are compared to the reference case.",

      "Title": "An Industrial Internet Application for Real-Time Fault Diagnosis in Industrial Motors",
      "Abstract": "Being able to detect, identify, and diagnose a fault is a key feature of industrial supervision systems, which enables advance asset management, in particular, predictive maintenance, which greatly increases efficiency and productivity. In this paper, an Industrial Internet app for real-time fault detection and diagnosis is implemented and tested in a pilot scale industrial motor. Real-time fault detection and identification is based on dynamic incremental principal component analysis (DIPCA) and reconstruction-based contribution (RBC). When the analysis indicates that one of the vibration measurements is responsible for the fault, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to identify the unbalance or bearing fault type. The application was evaluated in its three functionalities: fault detection, fault identification, and fault identification of vibration-related faults, yielding a fault detection rate over 99%, a false alarm rate below 5%, and an identification accuracy over 90%. Note to Practitioners - This paper focuses on designing and evaluating a real-time fault diagnosis application in an industrial setup. To this end, this paper also tackles the problem of developing a methodology for implementing advanced state-of-the-art fault detection techniques in real machinery, following industry standards and using a modern informatics architecture. The application here developed uses a statistical data-driven fault diagnosis technique, hence it requires a training stage using historical data to learn patterns and estimate parameters. A proof of concept in fault diagnosis for industrial motors is given; however, it should be noted that both the methodology and the deployed architecture are scalable and flexible enough to facilitate the implementation in other industrial environments. The implementation here presented was deployed using only open-source tools, which allows evaluating this tool without incurring in high expenses.",

      "Title": "An Integrative Machine Learning Method to Improve Fault Detection and Productivity Performance in a Cyber-Physical System",
      "Abstract": "A cyber-physical system (CPS) is one of the key technologies of industry 4.0. It is an integrated system that merges computing, sensors, and actuators, controlled by computer-based algorithms that integrate people and cyberspace. However, CPS performance is limited by its computational complexity. Finding a way to implement CPS with reduced complexity while incorporating more efficient diagnostics, forecasting, and equipment health management in a real-time performance remains a challenge. Therefore, the study proposes an integrative machine-learning method to reduce the computational complexity and to improve the applicability as a virtual subsystem in the CPS environment. This study utilizes random forest (RF) and a time-series deep-learning model based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) networking to achieve real-time monitoring and to enable the faster corrective adjustment of machines. We propose a method in which a fault detection alarm is triggered well before a machine fails, enabling shop-floor engineers to adjust its parameters or perform maintenance to mitigate the impact of its shutdown. As demonstrated in two empirical studies, the proposed method outperforms other times-series techniques. Accuracy reaches 80% or higher 3 h prior to real-time shutdown in the first case, and a significant improvement in the life of the product (281%) during a particular process appears in the second case. The proposed method can be applied to other complex systems to boost the efficiency of machine utilization and productivity.",

      "Abstract": "Digital twins (DT) are emerging as an extremely promising paradigm for run-time modelling and performability prediction of cyber-physical systems (CPS) in various domains. Although several different definitions and industrial applications of DT exist, ranging from purely visual three-dimensional models to predictive maintenance tools, in this paper, we focus on data-driven evaluation and prediction of critical dependability attributes such as safety. To that end, we introduce a conceptual framework based on autonomic systems to host DT run-time models based on a structured and systematic approach. We argue that the convergence between DT and self-adaptation is the key to building smarter, resilient and trustworthy CPS that can self-monitor, self-diagnose and - ultimately - self-heal. The conceptual framework eases dependability assessment, which is essential for the certification of autonomous CPS operating with artificial intelligence and machine learning in critical applications. This article is part of the theme issue 'Towards symbiotic autonomous systems'.",

Industry 4.0 comprises of elements from Cyber Physical Systems, Industrial IoT, Big data, Cloud Computing, AI and ML. However, Networking at the which is at the heart of these technologies has not had a major improvement, we wish to address this in this paper. The goal of this paper is to highlight the challenges in the current networking infrastructure for Industry 4.0 and propose a new standard for networking in Industry 4.0. Software Defined Networking is a emerging technology in the field of networking which provides for a centralised Control Plane and enables Network Function Virtualisation for Industry 4.0. OpenFlow Stack is used for building the solution. The outcomes of the paper include: Provide an SDN Architecture for the above system. Different zones have to be integrated to provide the ability for Centralized Control plane without compromising confidentiality. The system should be scalable for widespread deployment across multiple plants and manufacturers. This project deals with design and development of a Software Defined Networking (SDN) architecture for Industry 4.0, which involves integration of various components of OpenStack and openFlow. In this project, we identify the limitations and gaps in the current networking architecture for Industry 4.0 and propose a solution for the same. The openstack implementation of the project is done, Different Results of the implementation and its advantages are discussed along with scope for future implementation.

      "Abstract": "Two major trends are driving many companies in the manufacturing industry to rethink and reconfigure their business logic: the trends towards applying a service dominant business logic, and the trends towards collecting and using information about the market life cycle of products. The pursuit of market lifecycle information has lately been one that is driven mostly by tremendous developments in the area of the Internet of Things and information system integration. Companies in the manufacturing industry are reconfiguring their value chains, tending towards a higher degree of service orientation. This transformation requires an understanding of the principles behind offering additional value through industrial productservice systems. The design of an adequate information architecture and the subsequent management model are the key factors for a successful implementation. This chapter focuses on how information gathering, analysis, and the meaningful use of information have been linked to the success of those companies within the German manufacturing industry which have made the transformation towards service-orientation. On the basis of an empirical study, five success factors with a significant impact on either innovation performance and/or operational performance are identified. These findings are enhanced to derive guidelines for an adequate information architecture. The guidelines are underpinned by best practices of prosperous companies with a strong product-service-orientation. Links between best practice application and performance are analyzed, and significant relations are identified.",

      "Abstract": "Recent advances in smart manufacturing open up opportunities in industrial support, specifically in maintenance and physical asset management. This trend allows data collected from machines in operation to interact with cyberspace computers through a communication network, thus forming the concept of cyber-physical systems (CPS). Besides, rapid advances in information and communications technologies provide approaches for analysing data, in an increasingly rapid, autonomously, ubiquitous and in real time way, providing information that assists humans in making better decisions. In this sense, Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) of machines, is indicated as a promising application of Smart Manufacturing in the CPS context, demanding the standardization of concepts, terms, and a formal implementation of data collection and treatment. For this purpose, the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology is used in this paper, encompassing international standards, the unified 5-level architecture, ontology, and dependability for failure analysis in mechanical components. In addition, the creation of an ontology using the OWL 2 language was guided by the ‘Ontology Development 101′ approach. A pilot test was carried out using a centrifugal pump to demonstrate the applicability of the ontology. Thus, the ontology is evaluated in Protégé, which allow queries with SPARQL language to provide future decision-making for condition-based maintenance in real processes.",

      "Abstract": "Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are the complex systems that control and coordinate physical infrastructures, which may be geographically apart, via the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). One such application of CPS is smart microgrids. Microgrids comprise both power consuming and power producing infrastructure and are capable of operating in grid connected and disconnected modes. Due to the presence of heterogeneous smart devices communicating over multiple communication protocols in a distributed environment, a system architecture is required. The objective of this paper is to approach the microgrid architecture from the software and systems’ design perspective. The architecture should be flexible to support various multiple communication protocols and is able to integrate various hardware technologies. It should also be modular and scalable to support various functionalities such as island mode operations, energy efficient operations, energy trading, predictive maintenance, etc. These requirements are the basis for designing the software architecture for the smart microgrids that should be able to manage not only electrical but all energy related systems. In this work, we propose a distributed, hybrid control architecture suited for microgrid environments, where entities are geographically distant and need to operate in a cohesive manner. The proposed system architecture supports various design philosophies such as component-based design, hierarchical composition of components, peer-to-peer design, distributed decision-making and controlling as well as plug-and-play during runtime. A unique capability of the proposed system architecture is the self-similarity of the components for the distributed microgrids. The benefit of the approach is that it supports these design philosophies at all the levels in the hierarchy in contrast to a typical centralized architectures where decisions are taken only at the global level. The proposed architecture is applied to a real system of 13 residential buildings in a low-voltage distribution network. The required implementation and deployment details for monitoring and controlling 13 residential buildings are also discussed in this work.",

      "Title": "Application of Industry 4.0 in LPG condition monitoring and emergency systems using IoT approach",
      "Abstract": "Purpose: The Purpose of this research is to initiate the “Fourth Industrial Revolution” by using the Internet of things (IoT), which can be applied to flammable gas condition monitoring and detection of gas leakage and activate fire extinguisher in case of fire accidents. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) leakage and explosions cause many injuries and death each year. By developing an automated and remote LPG ppm condition monitoring and fire extinguisher activation system with the help of a cyber-physical system, the rate of accidents and injuries can be reduced to a significant amount. Design/methodology/approach: The IoT enabled the sensors to transmit LPG concentration value reading to a mobile app or cloud server and control actuators by connecting all in the same network. In case of a fire accident, the solenoid valve automatically or can be activated by an android application manually, which will be pre-installed in mobile phones. Another advantage of this system is that the gas cylinder or flammable particle source can be closed by closing the solenoid valves attached to their outlets. The first challenge of Industry 4.0 is to develop a cyber-physical system where all physical entities can be monitored and controlled over the internet or another way remotely or from a single point. Findings: This fire extinguisher system can be used everywhere and in all types of firefighting because all types of fire extinguishers are commercially available in cylinders where solenoid valves can be used instead of conventional valves. This system will reduce human effort in the fire safety system and reduce the number of losses owing to fire accidents by taking all actions automatically and from a safe distance. The reliability analysis of this system indicated that the working condition for the best outcome is 20–35°C and the baud rate of the controller should be 11.5 kHz. Originality/value: The study of pieces of the literature summarizes that this work is unique in terms of the application of Industry 4.0 in the fire safety system and reliability analysis of this system helped to determine the operating condition for the best performance of this system. Some LPG condition monitoring system was developed using IoT before but had many limitations such as working capability during load shading or emergency cases.",

A technique for the camera-less remote surveillance on the heavy equipment is presented. It uses the sensor data about the pressure and position of the hydraulic actuators transmitted in IoT environment to a digital twin that reproduces the motion of the machine using its dynamic model. The forces acting in the machine calculated by the digital twin give an ability to calculate the stress levels in the mechanical structure of the machine. These data can be used to estimate the fatigue life of the machine as part of the predictive maintenance practice.

The article discusses two types of forecasts - about the remaining useful life and the possible failure of an asset in the considered time window. Computational experiments have been carried out, confirming that the proposed neural network model allows, due to the simultaneous training of solving two problems, to obtain more accurate forecasts than models trained to solve one problem.",

      "Title": "Cloud architecture for industrial image processing: Platform for realtime inline quality assurance",
      "Abstract": "Cloud computing offers the opportunity to minimize the evaluation time of complex algorithms - e.g. needed for computational imaging - by horizontal scaling of the available computing resources. By this way, new image analyzing algorithms can be employed in weak real-time conditions, like inline quality analysis in production with time stamps in the order of several tens of seconds. The cloud offers a platform to merge sensor data of all production processes to analyze quality data comprehensively, e.g. for methods like predictive maintenance. Typically, cloud environments are applied for the Internet of things (IoT) or Big Data analysis. But IoT-applications usually generate very small data packages (like sensor values with a size much less than 1 megabyte), while BigData applications deal with very high data volume (terra-or petabyte). Image processing requires an environment, which is optimized for medium size data streaming, composed of images with a size in the lower megabyte range. In this paper, a sensor-to-cloud architecture as a platform for image processing is described. This approach is upward compatible, because it is not necessary to change the sensor hardware, e.g. if algorithms with considerable higher computing complexity are desired (like for a smart camera), so algorithms can be exchanged in the cloud without interrupting the production process.",

      "Abstract": "The condition-based maintenance (CBM) strategy has got new, powerful toolset recently: the concepts of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). These can provide flexible but powerful data collection and analysis methods for proactive and predictive maintenance. In the landscape of new digitalization and interconnection of products, services, processes, enterprises and people, IoT/CPS-based platforms are increasing in their size and target applications in a steady manner. Beside the fundamental research challenges regarding the reference architecture, interoperability, performance, quality and deployment issues, the challenges regarding system maintenance are also burning. There are various issues that are specific to the maintenance domain: interoperability and data flow management, data representation models, and data processing models and tools. The paper describes a maintenance reference architecture and platform, which aims to tackle all these challenges. The architecture suggested by the MANTIS project covers edge and cloud level interoperability, data flow management and data processing issues. Furthermore, it provides domain-specific methods for root cause analysis, failure prediction and models for predicting remaining useful life. The architecture is strengthened by the concept of MIMOSA, a data model definition that allows data representation models that are easy to fit into relational object and information management models required by CBM. The MANTIS platform utilizes the Arrowhead framework for tackling interoperability and integrability issues.",

      "Abstract": "Digital twin (DT) is a hot topic in information engineering, which has been introduced into the intelligent solution of the power grid system to deal with the reliability assurance issues of complex systems. Due to the lack of an operational application architecture model, it is impossible to map the complex system comprehensively. Based on the review of the concept model of DT and the current research situation in the smart grid (SG), an OKDD [i.e., ontology-body (OB), knowledge-body (KB), data-body (DB), and digital-portal (DP)] model of digital twin body (DTB) is proposed and specified in detail. Taking a vacuum circuit breaker and a 35 kV substation of the power grid as examples, the OKDD is applied in the DTB construction, and the developed prognostic and health management (PHM) system demo is practiced in a 110 kV substation simply. The approach is proved to be feasible preliminarily. This model provides a novel method for the unified description and standardization of DTB, which is conducive to the hierarchical creation (unit-system-system of systems) for complex systems. Meanwhile, it can represent complex physical entities more comprehensively, and enable the reuse of knowledge and the duplication of similar unit-level DTB rapidly. Thus, this research provides a new reference for the practical application of DT.",

      "Abstract": "Cyber Physical System (CPS) is one of the key technologies of industry 4.0. CPS is an integrated system that combines computing, sensors and actuators. CPS is controlled by computer-based algorithms that integrates people and internet. However, the performance of CPS is limited by its computational complexity. How to implement CPS with less computational complexity in a real time performance remains an important issue. Therefore, the study attempts to establish a CPS based on machine learning to reduce its complexity and improve applicability. This study applies a Fault Detection and Classification system (FDC) with machine learning method in the virtual subsystem of CPS. This study consists of two steps. Based on the data collected from sensors of CPS, Random Forest (RF) is used to figure out key factors that reduces the data dimension for less computational complexity. The process engineers will know which factors are causing the machine fails. The second step is to establish a time series model which bases on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to achieve real time monitoring of the machine. Before the machine fails, FDC will alarm that allow the engineer to adjust parameters of machines to avoid machine fails. The study in order to achieve the goals of predicting machines fails, figuring out key factors, predicting maintenance and increasing the productivity.",

      "Abstract": "Estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of components is a crucial task to enhance reliability, safety, productivity, and to reduce maintenance cost. In general, predicting the RUL of a component includes constructing a health indicator (H I) to infer the current condition of the component, and modelling the degradation process in order to estimate the future behavior. Although many signal processing and data‐driven methods have been proposed to construct the H I, most of the existing methods are based on manual feature extraction techniques and require the prior knowledge of experts, or rely on a large amount of failure data. Therefore, in this study, a new data‐driven method based on the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) is presented to construct the H I. For this purpose, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) technique was used to convert the raw acquired vibrational signals into a two‐dimensional image; then, the CAE model was trained by the healthy operation dataset. Finally, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) between the healthy and failure stages was measured as the H I. The proposed method was tested on a benchmark bearing dataset and compared with several other traditional H I construction models. Experimental results indicate that the constructed H I exhibited a monotonically increasing degradation trend and had good performance in terms of detecting incipient faults.",

      "Abstract": "The manufacturing industry is currently witnessing a huge revolution in terms of the Industry 4.0 paradigm, which aims to automate most of the manufacturing processes from condition monitoring of the machinery to optimizing production efficiency with automated robots and digital twins. One such valuable contribution of the Industry 4.0 paradigm is the concept of predictive maintenance (PdM), which aims to explore the contributions of artificial intelligence to get meaningful insights into the health of the machinery to enable timely maintenance. As majority of these machineries consist of bearings, bearing fault detection using artificial intelligence has been a popular choice for researchers. This paper provides a systematic literature survey of the existing research works in bearing fault detection. Further in this paper, we have done comparative analysis of bearing fault detection using the techniques of random forest classification, artificial neural network, and autoencoder on the benchmarked dataset provided by CWRU. The deep learning model of autoencoders provides the highest accuracy of 91% over the algorithms of artificial neural network and random forest.",

      "Abstract": "For machine manufacturing companies, besides the production of high quality and reliable machines, requirements have emerged to maintain machine-related aspects through digital services. The development of such services in the field of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is dealing with solutions such as effective condition monitoring and predictive maintenance. However, appropriate data sources are needed on which digital services can be technically based. As many powerful and cheap sensors have been introduced over the last years, their integration into complex machines is promising for developing digital services for various scenarios. It is apparent that for components handling recorded data of these sensors they must usually deal with large amounts of data. In particular, the labeling of raw sensor data must be furthered by a technical solution. To deal with these data handling challenges in a generic way, a sensor processing pipeline (SPP) was developed, which provides effective methods to capture, process, store, and visualize raw sensor data based on a processing chain. Based on the example of a machine manufacturing company, the SPP approach is presented in this work. For the company involved, the approach has revealed promising results.",

      "Title": "Approach for a Holistic Predictive Maintenance Strategy by Incorporating a Digital Twin",
      "Abstract": "Determination of the right time for machine maintenance is a major challenge for many industrial companies. Currently, most companies react on occurring breakdowns (reactive maintenance) or maintenance is carried out in scheduled time intervals (preventive maintenance). These results in either unexpected production stops, or a waste of machine working hours, because components are switched too early. Consequently, predictive maintenance strategies offer a big potential. An essential part of predictive maintenance is the estimation of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of machine assets. RUL estimation approaches are based on statistical methods and derived algorithms. Thus, a lot of data is needed for a good estimation. Additionally, data can be generated by means of simulation to improve the RUL estimation. However, companies hardly have an overview of available data and according modules, which are needed for a holistic predictive maintenance strategy. This paper shows an approach for a predictive maintenance strategy dealing with acquisition, processing, and analysis of historical field data as well as the generation of respective simulation data. A structured process map with a derived systematic strategy will give companies an idea of how they can integrate predictive maintenance into existing processes. By incorporating the concept of a digital twin of a production machine, the interaction of measured and estimated as well as generated data by means of simulation, are shown. The digital twin could deliver results to retrofit data-driven prediction models, in order to improve the estimation of the RUL.",

      "Title": "Automatic Digitization of Engineering Diagrams using Deep Learning and Graph Search",
      "Abstract": "A Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (PID) is a type of engineering diagram that uses symbols, text, and lines to represent the components and flow of an industrial process. Although used universally across industries such as manufacturing and oil gas, PIDs are usually trapped in image files with limited metadata, making their contents unsearchable and siloed from operational or enterprise systems. In order to extract the information contained in these diagrams, we propose a pipeline for automatically digitizing PIDs. Our pipeline combines a series of computer vision techniques to detect symbols in a diagram, match symbols with associated text, and detect connections between symbols through lines. For the symbol detection task, we train a Convolutional Neural Network to classify certain common symbols with over 90% precision and recall. To detect connections between symbols, we use a graph search approach to traverse a diagram through its lines and discover interconnected symbols. By transforming unstructured diagrams into structured information, our pipeline enables applications such as diagram search, equipment-to-sensor mapping, and asset hierarchy creation. When integrated with operational and enterprise data, the extracted asset hierarchy serves as the foundation for a facility-wide digital twin, enabling advanced applications such as machine learning-based predictive maintenance.",

      "Title": "PHM by Using Multi-Physics System-Level Modeling and Simulation for EMAs of Liquid Rocket Engine",
      "Abstract": "The need for condition-based maintenance to improve reusable launch vehicle readiness, reliability and safety, with affordable maintenance cost and quick turnaround time is recognized. But the problem of detecting faults and predicting failure in the components of reusable rocket engine systems is difficult and complex to solve. Since the number of data samples on the fault or failure status during the actual operation of the rocket engine is very small, it is difficult to adapt a data-drive approach of health management. Furthermore, the failure modes for these systems might transcend electrical, mechanical, and fluid systems. Therefore, one of the key concepts of the approach proposed in this study for fault detection and diagnosis is model-based quantitative assessment that considers system-level interactions in the target system. In this approach, multi-physics system-level modeling and simulation for a target system are conducted by using Modelica, an equation-based, object-oriented modeling language that allows acausal modeling for complex cyber-physical systems. Modelica has an important modeling capability for system-level interactions that involve multi-physics phenomena. One advantage of the model-based health-monitoring approach is that faults and failure modes are traced back to physically meaningful information, which is invaluable for the maintainer. Thus, this model-based approach for condition-based maintenance has the potential to provide reliable early fault detection and diagnosis during post-flight investigation for maintenance decision-making. In this study, multi-physics system-level modeling and simulation for a target system under both normal and abnormal conditions have been conducted based on an understanding of the failure mechanism to obtain prior data sets for fault detection and diagnosis. In this proposed approach, the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)algorithm was utilized to evaluate dissimilarity between the prior data sets and sensor measurement data obtained during the flight, and hierarchical clustering technique was applied for categorization in failure mode based on dissimilarity of these data. In addition, a trial case study has been conducted on electromechanical actuators (EMAs), an important component of a rocket engine, towards the construction of model-based prognostics and health management (PHM)technologies for reusable liquid rocket engines. Based on the trial results of the model-based approach constructed in this study, the possibility of fault detection and diagnosis was demonstrated for virtual EMAs of a liquid rocket engine.",

      "Title": "A novel approach for data-driven process and condition monitoring systems on the example of mill-turn centers",
      "Abstract": "Implementing condition monitoring functionality in production machinery often proves to be a difficult task. Device- and process-specific algorithms must be created while inhomogeneous industrial communication networks hinder the aggregation of control signals and process variables. Further challenges arise from the advance of flexible cyber-physical systems (CPS) and the industrial internet of things (IIoT). They demand a service-oriented condition monitoring architecture, which seamlessly adapts to quickly changing production topologies. In this context, data-driven systems which are capable of unsupervised learning are promising approaches. The aim is the autonomous identification of significant process variables and patterns. This paper describes a machine learning approach for a condition and process monitoring system on the basis of pattern recognition within structure-borne noise of rotating cutting machinery. Process states are defined under application of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). A production model is learned and deployed on the basis of Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and hidden Markov models (HMM) in a two stage process. Additionally a generic framework to ease the implementation of decentralized condition monitoring functionalities is given. A decentralized component, the monitoring module, constitutes a part of a holistic condition monitoring architecture managed by a central server. The approach is evaluated on the example of mill-turn centers.",

      "Abstract": "Nowadays the laser is a conventional tool in industrial manufacturing, for a wide spam of applications, from subtractive to additive, from cutting to welding. The main topic in production today is headlined with the word digitalization and Industry 4.0. In this context the laser is playing a dominant role, because it is possible to produce a part directly from a digital model by contactless processing. This unique feature allows for monitoring processes with smart devices, which is a key issue of Industry 4.0. Especially sensor technology is a leading part related to Smart Factory and predictive maintenance and even process control. Transforming machine elements into intelligent cyber physical systems involves the integration of smart sensors for condition and process monitoring. This contribution of Precitec to the SPIE LASE Conference will present some of the highlights in the area of laser metal deposition and 3D printing using innovative laser processing heads in combination with sensor strategies to fully monitor and even control the manufacturing process with the OCT sensor principle. Sensors based on OCT (optical coherence tomography)/low coherence interferometry are different to all the other technologies because the measurement is not affected by the process emissions and thus open new horizons in laser materials processing. The use of this method in laser applications has risen in the last years. Since its first appearance in 2008 [1], application examples were shown for laser cutting [2], selective laser melting [3], laser micro machining [4], laser drilling [5] and laser welding [6]. For the latter, a huge potential is foreseen [7] [8].",

      "Abstract": "Asset intensive Organizations have searched long for a framework model that would timely predict equipment failure. Timely prediction of equipment failure substantially reduces direct and indirect costs, unexpected equipment shutdowns, accidents, and unwarranted emission risk. In this paper, the author proposes a model that can predict equipment failure by using data from SAP Plant Maintenance module. To achieve that author has applied data extraction algorithm and numerous data manipulations to prepare a classification data model consisting of maintenance records parameters such as spare parts usage, time elapsed since last completed maintenance and the period to the next scheduled maintained and so on. By using unsupervised learning technique of clustering, the author observed a class to cluster evaluation of 80% accuracy. After that classifier model was trained using various machine language (ML) algorithms and subsequently tested on mutually exclusive data sets with an objective to predict equipment breakdown. The classifier model using ML algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT) returned an accuracy and true positive rate (TPR) of greater than 95% to predict equipment failure. The proposed model acts as an Advanced Intelligent Control system contributing to the Cyber-Physical Systems for asset intensive organizations.",

      "Abstract": "Modern manufacturing industry is currently facing significant challenges with regard to the concept of Industry 4.0. The promise of increased productivity and flexibility in manufacturing processes can not be achieved without implementation of systems and advance methods based on smart technologies. Implementation of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), Condition Monitoring, Big Data, Cloud computing, virtual and augmented reality in maintenance processes will significantly increase the effectivy and quality of manufacturing processes as well as eliminate the human factor. Under this perspective, cyber-physical systems can be accessible from remote location; process paramters can be visualized at real time and prediction of unexpected production stop due to machine breakdown will be significantly reduced. The paper deals with the development of effective approach to real-Time process control using parameters visualization of manufacturing process with the use of augmented reality smart glasses. Collected data from condition monitoring sensors from electric monorail system are evaluated in real time and visualized in the field of maintainer view. Critical values from field of sensors are highlighted and enable to predict manufacturing breakdowns. On real example from automotive industry will be demonstrated the signification and effectivity for maintenance of electric monorail system and potential for application in different types of modern industrial processes with the focus on rule-based intelligent predictive maintenance control.",

      "Abstract": "The recent advances in sensor and communication technologies can provide the foundations for linking the physical manufacturing facility and machine world to the cyber world of Internet applications. The coupled manufacturing cyber-physical system is envisioned to handle the actual operations in the physical world while simultaneously monitor them in the cyber world with the help of advanced data processing and simulation models at both the manufacturing process and system operational levels. Moreover, a sensor-packed manufacturing system in which each process or piece of equipment makes available event and status information, coupled with market research for true advanced Big Data analytics, seem to be the right ingredients for event response selection and operation virtualization. As a drawback, the resulting manufacturing cyber-physical system will be vulnerable to the inevitable cyber-attacks, unfortunately, so common for the software and Internet-based systems. This reality makes cybersecurity penetration within the manufacturing domain a need that goes uncontested across researchers and practitioners. This work provides a review of the current status of virtualization and cloud-based services for manufacturing systems and of the use of Big Data analytics for planning and control of manufacturing operations. Building on already developed cloud business solutions, cloud manufacturing is expected to offer improved enterprise manufacturing and business decision support. Based on the current state-of-the-art cloud manufacturing solutions and Big Data applications, this work also proposes a framework for the development of predictive manufacturing cyber-physical systems that include capabilities for attaching to the Internet of Things, and capabilities for complex event processing and Big Data algorithmic analytics.",

When collaborative prognosis is implemented in a computationally distributed framework, each asset is monitored by its corresponding Digital Twin agent. Distributed collaborative prognosis is particularly beneficial for high value assets where the communication and the processing costs are negligible compared to the maintenance costs. This paper analyses the effects of Digital Twin deployment strategies on the effectiveness of predictive maintenance activities relying on distributed collaborative prognosis. Distributed and heterarchical multi-agent system architectures are analysed for large fleets of assets, with varying failure rates and noise levels in the failure data. The results show that no single architecture or deployment strategy can be deemed best across all failure rates and noise levels. The conclusion derived in this paper provides guidance to the asset owners to choose the most suitable combination for a given application.",

Based on literature reviews and industry requirements for a cyber-physical digital twin system for manufacturing, this paper proposed a concept design architecture of a cyber-physical digital twin system and its implementation methodology. An application of building a cyber-physical digital twin system for a Surface-Mounted-Technology (SMT) line is illustrated based on the proposed concept and framework. The basic requirements of the proposed cyber-physical digital twin system are divided into three layers, i.e. operations layer, visualization layer, and intelligence layer. Operations layer is about systems modeling of the physical processes and establishing connections with the cyberspace. Visualization layer is related to the collection and displaying of the historical and present data in a visual manner. The intelligence layer is the ability to conduct data analytics and decision makings to identify patterns and bottlenecks, reduce waste, perform predictive maintenance, etc. A proof of the concept prototype is developed based on the proposed cyber-physical digital twin system for a SMT line.",

This effect is forcing manufacturers to squeeze every asset for maximum value and thereby calls for high-equipment effectiveness, and at the same time flexible and resilient manufacturing systems. Maintenance operations are essential to modern manufacturing systems in terms of minimizing unplanned down time, assuring product quality, reducing customer dissatisfaction, and maintaining advantages and competitiveness edge in the market. It has a long history that manufacturers struggle to find balanced maintenance strategies without significantly compromising system reliability or productivity. Intelligent maintenance systems (IMS) are designed to provide decision support tools to optimize maintenance operations. Intelligent prognostic and health management tools are imperative to identify effective, reliable, and cost-saving maintenance strategies to ensure consistent production with minimized unplanned downtime. This article aims to present a comprehensive review of the recent efforts and advances in prominent methods for maintenance in manufacturing industries over the last decades, identifying the existing research challenges, and outlining directions for future research.",

      "Abstract": "Cyber-physical systems are increasingly automated and interconnected. Strategies like predictive maintenance are on the rise and as a result new streams of data will flow through these systems. This data is often confidential, which can be a problem in these low-security systems. In addition, more stakeholders are now involved and various cloud-based service providers are utilised. Companies often no longer know who gets to see their data. This paper presents a methodology that aims to analyse these data flows. The methodology takes as input a set of data asset preferences and service policies, as well as the asset flow of the system. It then returns feedback in the form of an asset profile showing which stakeholders have access to what data assets, and conflicts between the preferences and the modeled situation. Several possible actors with different preferences are modeled for each stakeholder role in the system, the scenarios with the fewest conflicts are returned. The methodology is validated on a case study and has been added to the FAST-CPS framework.",

      "Abstract": "Machine breakdowns in industrial plants cause production delays and financial damage. In the era of cyber-physical systems, machines are equipped with a variety of sensors to monitor their status. For example, changes to sensor values might indicate an abnormal behavior and, in some cases, detected anomalies can be even used to predict machine breakdowns. This procedure is called predictive maintenance, which pursues the goal to increase machine productivity by reducing down times. Thereby, anomalies can be either detected by training data models based on historic data or by implementing a self-learning approach. In this work, the use of neural networks for detecting anomalies is evaluated. In the considered scenarios, anomaly detection is based on temperature data from a press of a machine manufacturer. Based on this, a framework was developed for different types of neural networks as well as a high-order linear regression approach. We use the proposed neural networks for restoring missing sensor values and to improve overall anomaly detection. An evaluation of the used techniques revealed that the high-order linear regression and an autoencoder constitute best practices for data recovery. Moreover, deep neural networks, especially convolutional neural networks, provide the best results with respect to overall anomaly detection.",

      "Abstract": "With the advent of Industry 4.0, maintenance strategy faces new demands to avoid the hysteresis of the conventional passive maintenance mode and the non-feasibility of the periodic preventive maintenance model. In view of the inherent polymorphism of manufacturing systems and with the objective of maximizing benefits, a novel cost-oriented predictive maintenance based on mission reliability state for manufacturing systems is proposed. First, the cyber-physical system is adopted to organize and analyze big data in the operational process of manufacturing systems in terms of predictive analytics in cyber manufacturing environment. Second, a new connotation of mission reliability is defined based on the big operational data to comprehensively characterize the dynamic state of the equipment health states and the qualified degree of the production task. Third, the predictive maintenance mode based on mission reliability state is quantified by the comprehensive cost, and the relationship between mission reliability and cost is established. Thereafter, cost-oriented dynamic predictive maintenance strategy is proposed. Finally, a case study on the maintenance decision-making problem of a cylinder head manufacturing system is presented. The final result shows that the comprehensive cost can be further reduced by the proposed method relative to the traditional periodic preventive maintenance strategy.",

      "Abstract": "The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) will be fully commissioned later in 2019. Once commissioned, operation and maintenance of FAST will be the most prominent task. The unique working mode of active shape-changing of FAST cable-net structure makes the traditional maintenance way, which combines routine inspection with preventive maintenances not only expensive, but also unable to effectively avoid potential risks in operations. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an economical and reliable operation/maintenance technology for FAST cable-net structure. In this paper, a Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) system is proposed based on the advanced Digital Twin (DT) technology. Through the finite element analysis of DT model, the current safety status of FAST cable-net is evaluated, and the fatigue life of components in the cable-net is predicted. Hence Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) of FAST cable-net structure can be realized. The PHM system described in this paper can effectively guarantee the healthy and safe operation of the FAST cable-net structure, greatly improve the maintenance efficiency and reduce the cost for maintenance works.",

Also, how to build a smart manufacturing platform that can facilitate realizing smart factories is essential and desirable for current manufacturing industries. Aimed at addressing the above-mentioned two issues, in this letter, a five-stage approach for enhancing and assuring yield is proposed. Also, a smart manufacturing platform-Advanced Manufacturing Cloud of Things (AMCoT) based on Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data analytics, cyber-physical systems, and prediction technologies is designed and implemented to realize the proposed five-stage approach of yield enhancement and assurance. Finally, AMCoT is applied to a bumping process of a semiconductor company in Taiwan to conduct industrial case studies. Testing results demonstrate that AMCoT possesses capabilities of conducting total inspection in production, providing prognosis, and predictive maintenance on equipment, finding the root cause of yield loss, and storing and handling big production data, which as a whole is promising to achieve the goal of zero defects.",

      "Abstract": "The increasing IoT technology provides large volume of data from various industrial applications, but the gap between the conventional automatic management system and the industry 4.0 system is how to convert the data to information, and then how to use the information to better assist the decision support and optimization in various aspects, including scheduling, planning, supply chain optimization, etc. Cyber physical systems connect the physical assets with the cyber computational capability, in which smart analytics are applied to make the invisible issues transparency and enable rapid and optimized decision-making. In this paper, a framework of CPS is presented to describe the CPS as a 5C architecture, including Connection level, Conversion level, Cyber level, Cognition level and Configuration level. The 5C architecture clearly states how to convert data to information; so the transparency and predictability enable to predict the degradation of the critical assets so as to use the information for smarter decision support. The transformation from traditional maintenance strategy to predictive maintenance strategy is the highlight to enable the worry-free entities. In order to fully understand the CPS architecture and how it can be applied to various industrial applications to realize a worry-free system, two successful case studies of CPS applications are introduced to present the application of CPS enabled cyber manufacturing with critical component health management as an example, and the worry-free wind turbine health management system.",

      "Title": "Cyber-physical approach for integrated energy and maintenance management",
      "Abstract": "Because of nowadays complex and highly automated industrial production lines, every stoppage involves the danger of a massive economic harm. That’s why companies use already various production, quality and maintenance methods to reduce—or at least to handle—unforeseen stoppages. This paper presents a novel approach to improve the reliability of production fields by supporting predictive maintenance under the combination of systems from energy and maintenance management. Wireless sensor networks and mobile devices are integrated into a cyber-physical system to gain real-time transparency of energy demands within production environments. Being aware of challenges introducing cyber-physical systems into the brownfield, the proposed solution considers needs of data standardisations, IT security, staff participation, big data handling, long-term technical risk and cost-benefit estimations. The developed methods are considered by user-oriented design principles to deliver role-specific information. Therefore, the derivation of these informational requirements is based on production unique job activities. Allocating time and component-based energy demands whilst taking machine and environmental conditions into account enables a basis of comparison and a continuous improvement process of energy efficiency and maintenance. These demands are fulfilled by the methods of a continuous energy value stream mapping, an energy efficiency tracker and an integrating energy and maintenance monitoring. This proposed approach is based on the ESIMA project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.

      "Title": "Application of structural health monitoring for structural digital twin",
      "Abstract": "The load-carrying capability of marine steel structures often suffers degradation and at times structural failure during their service life due to the corrosive sea environment and the extreme wave loads which they experience. Structural integrity is a high priority during asset design and operation to preserve human safety, environment protection, and to maintain operations. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), a process of deriving the health status and predicting structural damage via sensor-based measurements, data trending and analysis, has been commonly implemented in marine and offshore assets for decades. There are mature commercial SHM products on the market and available international and industrial regulations, guidance and classification rules (such as IMO MSC/ Circ. 646, ABS Guide for Hull Condition Monitoring Systems, etc.). With the emergence of the Structural Digital Twin (SDT) concept in the marine industry in the recent years, the application of structural sensors on marine structures and the integration between sensor-based SHM techniques and structural digital twin approaches have attracted more attention. As a digital representation of the physical asset, the structural digital twin typically involves multiple-scale, multiple-physics, and data driven models and simulations. Leveraging the high fidelity full-scale SHM data, the structural digital twin is capable to provide more accurate assessments, predictions, and insights on structural integrity conditions and support the decision-making process regarding asset operation, structural inspection, repairs, and condition-based asset integrity management. This paper reviews the mature and commonly employed SHM sensor techniques (such as electric resistance strain gauge, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) strain gauge, accelerometer, pressure transducer, etc.) and discusses their implementation on marine assets and integration with structural digital twin. The paper elaborates to provide some general guidance on the selection of the structural sensors and their installation, as well as the proper sensor specification, in the context of a structural digital twin implementation. The paper also discusses the required engineering mindsets and skillsets for developing and deploying sensor plans, and for implementing a sensor-based structural digital twin framework. The paper concludes that a successful SHM plan and structural digital twin implementation rely on sensor planning, data acquisition, data processing, analytic models and a proper integration of the data and data analytics. The overall planning and implementation should be governed by the suitability for the business purpose and implementation expectation.",

      "Abstract": "The fundamental process of predictive maintenance is prognostics and health management, and it is the tool resulting in the development of many algorithms to predict the remaining useful life of industrial equipment. A new data-driven predictive maintenance and an architectural impulse, based on a regularized deep neural network using predictive analytics, are proposed successfully for ring spinning technology. The paradigm shift in computational infrastructures enormously puts pressure on large-scale linear and non-linear automated assembly systems to eliminate and cut down unscheduled downtime and unexpected stoppages. The sensor network designed for the scheduling process comprises different critical components of the same spinning machine frames containing more than thousands of spindles attached to them. We established a genetic algorithm based on multi-sensor performance assessment and prediction procedure for the spinning system. Results show that it operates with a relatively less amount of training data sets but takes advantage of larger volumes of data. This integrated system aims to prognosticate abnormalities, disturbances, and failures by providing condition-based monitoring for each component, which makes it more accurate to locate the defined component failures in the current spinning spindles by using smart agents during the operations through the neural sensing network. A case study has provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed predictive model for highly dynamic, high-speed textile spinning system through real-time data sensing and signal processing via the industrial Internet of Things.",

      "Title": "Assessment of crack path uncertainly using 3d fea and response surface modeling",
      "Abstract": "Uncertainty quantification in fatigue crack growth predictions is an important aspect in structural health monitoring system development or achieving the goals of digital twin concepts. A crack propagation life assessment (crack path, remaining useful life-RUL) needs to account for variations in component geometry, loading conditions, material properties and uncertainty of the damage size. A statistical assessment of the consequences of crack growth is often difficult to achieve due to complexity of the loading mission, availability of simulation capabilities or cost of the computational simulations. Using state of the art meshing technologies to simulate non-planar crack propagation in three-dimensional (3D) geometries coupled with readily available response surface models, this study aims to show feasibility in: (1) performing deterministic crack growth predictions taking into account variability from different sources; (2) training a response surface model based on deterministic predictions; (3) verifying the calibrated response surface model and, (4) assessing the crack path and remaining useful life scatter.",

This framework provides a wide range of functions, including data collection, smart data preprocessing, smart data mining and smart data visualization. Design/methodology/approach: The architecture of CPS was designed with cyber layer, physical layer and communication layer from the perspective of big data processing. The BDA model was integrated into a CPS that enables managers to make sound decisions. Findings: The effectiveness of the proposed BDA model has been demonstrated by two practical cases − the prediction of energy output of the power grid and the estimate of the remaining useful life of the aero-engine. The method can be used to control the power supply system and help engineers to maintain or replace the aero-engine to maintain the safety of the aircraft. Originality/value: The communication layer, which connects the cyber layer and physical layer, was designed in CPS. From the communication layer, the redundant raw data can be converted into smart data. All the necessary functions of data collection, data preprocessing, data storage, data mining and data visualization can be effectively integrated into the BDA model for CPS applications. These findings show that the proposed BDA model in CPS can be used in different environments and applications.",

      "Title": "Deep digital maintenance",
      "Abstract": "With the emergence of Industry 4.0, maintenance is considered to be a specific area of action that is needed to successfully sustain a competitive advantage. For instance, predictive maintenance will be central for asset utilization, service, and after-sales in realizing Industry 4.0. Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI) is also central for Industry 4.0, and offers data-driven methods. The aim of this article is to develop a new maintenance model called deep digital maintenance (DDM). With the support of theoretical foundations in cyber-physical systems (CPS) and maintenance, a concept for DDM is proposed. In this paper, the planning module of DDM is investigated in more detail with realistic industrial data from earlier case studies. It is expected that this planning module will enable integrated planning (IPL) where maintenance and production planning can be more integrated. The result of the testing shows that both the remaining useful life (RUL) and the expected profit loss indicator (PLI) of ignoring the failure can be calculated for the planning module. The article concludes that further research is needed in testing the accuracy of RUL, classifying PLI for different failure modes, and testing of other DDM modules with industrial case studies.",

      "Abstract": "Physical devices have been integrated with artificial intelligence to create Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) can provide pro-activity and autonomy using agents, social organizations, and environment modeling by means of artifacts. Usually, some works that use MAS for interfacing physical environments employ agents accessing directly all the available data of the environment, which could overload this agent. This issue could be avoided if there were tools to facilitate the integration of sensors and actuators as artifacts into the physical environment. Therefore, the objective of this work is to create physical artifacts capable of accessing hardware devices from a physical environment to be used by agents in a MAS. As the Oil & Gas industry demands robustness in its equipment and an ability to do predictive maintenance, a case study including MAS and CPS was developed and some tests were carried out to validate the functioning of physical artifacts.",

      "Title": "Methodical evaluation of sensor positions for condition monitoring of gears",
      "Abstract": "With the increasing digitalization of mechanical engineering and the development of mechanical systems into cyber-physical systems, predictive maintenance and condition monitoring have become more widespread in technical applications. However, the fault diagnosis and especially the prognosis of remaining useful lifetime is still not accurate in many applications. This paper presents a methodical approach for evaluating and choosing measurands and sensor positions in order to improve condition monitoring systems by enhancing the quality of the measurement data. The underlying concept of sensor-based condition monitoring systems is that faults affect measurable properties of the machine, enabling the deduction of the fault status by analyzing the measured data. Most current systems use quantities that are easy to measure, like vibration at the machine housing, and successively apply advanced data processing methods for diagnosis and prognosis. For many failure mechanisms, these commonly used measurands are too far away from the actual fault location, e.g. a tooth root crack in a spur gear transmission. This leads to a loss of information between the fault location and the sensor: The property of interest (depth of the tooth root crack) is transformed into a variation of the contact force and mechanical vibration. Thus, the vibration can be seen as a mechanical signal, which is masked by disturbances, attenuated and modified along the transmission path from its source to the sensor. Therefore, the information about the fault, which is conveyed by the vibration signal, is more accurate when the sensor is positioned close to the fault location. The consequential problem for the developer of condition monitoring systems is to choose measurands and sensor positions in order to maximize the quality of the gathered data. A methodical approach for evaluating measurands and sensor positions is presented and explained in this paper using the example of gear condition monitoring. First, possible measurands and sensor positions are explained. Then, sensor positions for vibration-based condition monitoring are evaluated by estimating and measuring the vibration transfer function between the fault location (gear tooth) to various sensor positions, both on the shaft and on the housing. The results show that the bearings, due to their compliance, isolate vibration and thus decrease the information content of vibration measurements at the housing, compared to measurement on the shaft. Therefore, it is proposed to develop new sensor concepts that allow cyber-physical systems to reach deep into machines and gather relevant information closer to the actual point of interest, in this case the fault location.",

The aggressive push toward data collection in cloud-based and cyber-physical systems provides both challenges and opportunities for predictive analytics. One of the key applications of predictive analytics in such domains is predictive quality management that aims to fully exploit the potentials provided by the enormous data collected via cloud-based systems. As a case study, a data set of hard disk drives' Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) attributes from a cloud-storage service provider has been analyzed to derive some insights about the challenges and opportunities of using product lifecycle data. An analysis of time-to-failure monitoring of hard disk drives in real-time has been carried out and the corresponding challenges have been discussed.",

      "Title": "Composite material remaining useful life estimation using an IoT-compatible probabilistic modeling framework",
      "Abstract": "Monitoring real-time failure in fiber-reinforced composites using nondestructive evaluation (NDE) is a fairly difficult task due to the associated evolving material state uncertainties, as well as due to data management mining and signal processing challenges. In this context, a number of statistical, probabilistic and physics-based models have been proposed to make predictions of remaining useful life (RUL) in the built environment. In parallel to modeling efforts, the data quality from sensing, NDE and testing methods is compromised by a variety of intrinsic (hardware) and extrinsic (noise) factors that make the damage assessment process both challenging to visualize and computationally expensive to analyze. Most importantly, the uncertainties in the recorded data, also hinder efforts to create data-driven methods in the framework of what is currently called digital twin modeling. To address such issues more efficient data workflows and processing procedures are currently sought to assist with both damage monitoring assessment, as well as modeling and predictions. The objective, therefore, of this manuscript is to present a novel data-driven probabilistic modeling methodology that is capable of producing RUL estimates for composites. The framework consists of two parts: the hardware/software integration that allows the establishment of data streaming and handling procedures that ultimately feed in real time the probabilistic approach. The proposed probabilistic modeling approach is based on the use of an outlier analysis combined with information quality metrics to identify a given set of degradation states. Predictions of RUL are then made by extracting and processing features from NDE dataseis which are then used in unsupervised clustering. Such information is subsequently leveraged to train a support vector machine (S VM) alongside a hidden Markov chain model (HMM). The signal classifications from SVM combined with the HMM are then used as inputs for an adaptive neuro-fuzzy network that produces the RUL predictions. An application of the proposed approach in mechanical testing experiments of an aerospace-grade composite material is presented. Extensions that can make this approach applicable to industrial applications as well as in digital twin implementations are discussed.",

      "Abstract": "A generic framework for prognostics and health monitoring (PHM) which is rapidly deployable to heterogeneous fleets of assets would allow for the automation of predictive maintenance scheduling directly from operational data. Deep learning based PHM implementations provide part of the solution, but their main benefits are lost when predictions still rely on historical failure data and case-by-case feature engineering. We propose a solution to these challenges in the form of a Deep Digital Twin (DDT). The DDT is constructed from deep generative models which learn the distribution of healthy data directly from operational data at the beginning of an asset's life-cycle. As the DDT learns the distribution of healthy data it does not rely on historical failure data in order to produce an estimation of asset health. This article presents an overview of the DDT framework and investigates its performance on a number of datasets. Based on these investigations, it is demonstrated that the DDT is able to detect incipient faults, track asset degradation and differentiate between failure modes in both stationary and non-stationary operating conditions when trained on only healthy operating data.",

Solving these challenges is of uttermost importance to mission-critical industrial operations. Furthermore, effective application of predictive maintenance requires well-trained machine learning algorithms which on their turn require high volumes of reliable data. This paper addresses both challenges and presents the Smart Maintenance Living Lab, an open test and research platform that consists of a fleet of drivetrain systems for accelerated lifetime tests of rolling-element bearings, a scalable IoT middleware cloud platform for reliable data ingestion and persistence, and a dynamic dashboard application for fleet monitoring and visualization. Each individual component within the presented system is discussed and validated, demonstrating the feasibility of IIoT applications for smart machine maintenance. The resulting platform provides benchmark data for the improvement of machine learning algorithms, gives insights into the design, implementation and validation of a complete architecture for IIoT applications with specific requirements concerning robustness, scalability and security and therefore reduces the reticence in the industry to widely adopt these technologies.",

      "Abstract": "Predictive maintenance has been proposed to maximize the overall plant availability of modern manufacturing systems. To this end, research has been conducted mainly on data-driven prognostic techniques for machinery equipment individual components. However, the lack of historical data together with the intricate design of industrial machines, e.g. robots, stimulate the use of advanced methods exploiting simulation capabilities. This paper aims to address this challenge by introducing a generic framework for the enhancement of advanced physics-based models with degradation curves. The creation of a robot's simulation model and its enrichment with data from the degradation curves of the robot's components is presented. Following, the extraction of information from degradation curves during the simulation of the robot's dynamic behaviour is addressed. The Digital Twin concept is employed to monitor the health status of the robot and ensure the convergence of the simulated to the actual robot behaviour. The output of the simulation can enable to estimate the future behaviour of the robot and make predictions for the quality of the products to be produced, as well as to estimate the robot's Remaining Useful Life. The proposed approach is applied in a case study coming from the white goods industry, where it is investigated whether the robot will experience some failure within the next 18 months.",

      "Abstract": "The recent advances in Smart Manufacturing open opportunities in Maintenance and Management of its assets through new support strategies. This trend allows the collection of machine operation data in the shop floor, in order to interact with cyberspace computers through a communication network, therefore enabling the Cyber Physical System concept (CPS). Furthermore, the rapid advances of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) provide means to analyze Big Data, more quickly, autonomously, ubiquitously and in real time, offering information that assist in more efficient decision making in manufacturing processes. Nowadays, Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) leverages researches in the new generation of manufacturing. For this, an architecture called 5Cs, that directs the PHM implementation in CPS context is being adopted with expressive results, which allows the application of several math and/or Artificial Intelligence techniques to estimate the assets' remaining useful life. In particular, the use of Experts Systems and semantic information modeling can make it possible to represent knowledge found in the scientific literature and consolidated standards about the subject. This paper uses methodology of ontology development 101, which guides management, development and documenting of a formal taxonomy of failure prognostics. For model creation and evaluation, the Protégé suite is used, for it allows future researches to interact with the model, such as monitoring techniques and failure diagnostics in order to simulate real cases of mechanical components. This way, new possibilities for cyberspace oriented application development for industrial machine health management are revealed.",

      "Abstract": "The fourth industrial revolution promotes Industrial Cyber Physical Systems (ICPS) as the key to achieve smart, efficient, flexible and self-organizing production plants. In a shop floor there are heterogeneous physical and logical assets that form the ICPS. But without proper communication and composition techniques the integration of these assets in ICPS is compromised. Component Based Software Engineering (CBSE) is a discipline of growing relevance for ICPS because integration and composition issues have been extensively researched in the software domain. Under the Reference Architecture for Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0), the Industry 4.0 Component Model inherits aspects of CBSE to specify how several industrial plant assets can form an ICPS. The technological aspects for physical assets digitalization and integration have been explored, but the I4.0 Component model lacks proposals and use cases for dealing with industrial software components. In this work we discuss the development of the Smart Component Model as a proposal for integration of software components in ICPS. Furthermore, we focus on how prediction and monitoring applications could be converted in I4.0 Components and integrated in ICPS. To sustain our proposals, we describe a real industrial case study where these developments are being applied.",

      "Title": "A data pipeline for PHM data-driven analytics in large-scale smart manufacturing facilities",
      "Abstract": "The term smart manufacturing refers to a future-state of manufacturing, where the real-time transmission and processing of information across the factory will be used to produce advanced manufacturing intelligence that can optimize every aspect of its operation. In recent years, initiatives and groups such as the Smart Manufacturing Leadership Coalition (SMLC), Industry 4.0, and the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC), have led the way by bringing together industry, academia and government to establish policies, roadmaps and platforms to support smart manufacturing. Although there are many characteristics that can be associated with smart manufacturing across these initiatives, a common theme is the emphasis on transitioning operations from reactive and responsive, to predictive and preventative. The research presented in this paper focuses on the development of a data pipeline that supports the development of data-driven Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) applications. In the context of smart manufacturing, PHM enables facilities to transition from preventative and reactive maintenance strategies, to predictive, preventative and condition-based strategies. The benefits that can be derived by PHM are aligned with those of smart manufacturing, which include the opportunity to decrease costs, increase machine availability, reduce energy consumption, and improve production yield. However, the process of ingesting, cleaning and transforming real-time data streams for data-driven PHM is a difficult, complex and time-consuming task, with estimates from business intelligence projects ranging from 80% to 90% of total project effort. This effort may only be exacerbated further in manufacturing environments due to additional technology challenges, such as low levels of standardization, disparate protocols and interfaces, and ad hoc data management. While emerging technologies such as Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT) can overcome many of these challenges and provide an open platform for transmitting data, existing large-scale manufacturing facilities that are subject to compliance, regulation, and stringent quality assurance policies may not be able to adopt these technologies in the short-term due to the associated cost, risk and effort. Therefore, PHM applications that need to access data streams in large-scale manufacturing facilities must do so using transparent data integration that does not discriminate between emerging and legacy technologies in the factory. To this end, this research presents a real-time, scalable, robust, and fault tolerant data pipeline for ingesting, cleaning, transforming, processing and contextualizing time-series data from a wide-range of sources in the factory.",

      "Title": "An ultrafast crack growth lifing model to support digital twin, virtual testing, and probabilistic damage tolerance applications",
      "Abstract": "New aeronautical technologies like the Airframe Digital Twin, Virtual Fatigue Testing, and Probabilistic Damage Tolerance Analysis require a very large number of crack growth evaluations with a comprehensive number of random variables in order to accurately predict the fatigue life, the structural risk, or the remaining useful life of a structure. Current state-of-the-art crack growth methodologies and probabilistic methods do not make these new technologies possible due to limitations on computational speed, number of random variables, and statistical tools. In this work, a new computational strategy is developed and demonstrated such that several random variables directly affecting the crack growth analysis can be considered. This approach provides the opportunity for a more comprehensive and accurate digital twin evaluation, virtual testing prediction, and risk assessment, hence, improving aircraft design, safety, and reliability. Under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Funding, This methodology focused on the development of an ultrafast numerical crack growth algorithm that consists of: (a) a constant amplitude equivalent stress derived from a variable amplitude loading spectrum, and (b) an adaptive step-size Runge-Kutta ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver. Several examples with the Airframe Digital Twin, Virtual Fatigue Testing, and Probabilistic Damage Tolerance applications will be demonstrated using through, corner, and surface cracks at a hole under representative loading spectra. The crack size versus cycles results from this new approach will be compared against results obtained from commercial lifing software codes. All results to date indicate the comparison is within a few percent. The probabilistic crack growth analysis has been parallelized using OpenMP in order to fully utilize multi-core computers. This approach provides a more comprehensive and accurate risk assessment, hence, improving aircraft safety and reliability.",

Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. Industry 4.0, otherwise known as the fourth industrial revolution, integrates people and digitally controlled machines with the internet and information technology. The most commonly used terms to describe the new development that is changing the industrial aspects, are Industry 4.0, Cyber-physical Systems, and the Internet of Things (IOT), which pave the way for smart production factories and the digital transformation. Models of CPS of Industry 4.0 (CPSI 4.0) present a high level of combination and coordination between physical and computational elements aiming to improve productivity and decrease production costs. This paper introduces a testbed for a cyber-physical system of Industry 4.0. The testbed is a serial line equipped with sensors to collect data at both the machine and system level. Various tools were utilized to aggregate, analyze, and display this data and prepare it for processing over the cloud. The implemented system leverages many of Industry 4.0 features such as predictive maintenance, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), condition monitoring, communication technology and simple cyber-physical system security. The work presented is the basis for building a larger research testbed that could allow multidisciplinary research projects in this domain.",

      "Abstract": "Managing the physical and compute infrastructure of a large data center is an embodiment of a Cyber-Physical System (CPS). The physical parameters of the data center (such as power, temperature, pressure, humidity) are tightly coupled with computations, even more so in upcoming data centers, where the location of workloads can vary substantially due, for example, to workloads being moved in a cloud infrastructure hosted in the data center. In this paper, we describe a data collection and distribution architecture that enables gathering physical parameters of a large data center at a very high temporal and spatial resolution of the sensor measurements. We think this is an important characteristic to enable more accurate heat-flow models of the data center and with them, find opportunities to optimize energy consumption. Having a high resolution picture of the data center conditions, also enables minimizing local hotspots, perform more accurate predictive maintenance (pending failures in cooling and other infrastructure equipment can be more promptly detected) and more accurate billing. We detail this architecture and define the structure of the underlying messaging system that is used to collect and distribute the data. Finally, we show the results of a preliminary study of a typical data center radio environment. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",

In 2016, the total length of HSR in China has reached to 22,000 kilometers, and there are over 2,000 pairs of high speed trains operating daily. With the advancement of design and manufacturing technologies, the reliability and construction costs have been improved significantly. However, there is still great need for reduction of their operation and maintenance costs. With such incentive, a pilot project has been launched to develop a prognostics and health management system for rolling stock to transform the maintenance paradigm from preventive to predictive maintenance. Considering the high task variety and big data environment in HSR real-time monitoring system, a cyberphysical system (CPS) architecture is proposed as the framework for its PHM system. This paper reviews the needs of predictive maintenance for the HSR system, and then present a concept design of the CPS-enabled smart operation and maintenance system.",

      "Abstract": "Quality inspection in high volume manufacturing often depends on manual decision-making processes and predictive condition based maintenance. Predictive maintenance as a part of defect detection related to indicators and environmental impact in production development. Use of Zero Defect (ZD) methods or Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) will give great value to reduction of scrap rates, fault and defects. Scrap rates is often a huge problem due to different conditions in the production system, and will often cause impact on the delivery to costumer. To provide a self-correcting system by use of machine control data and augmented reality (AR) solutions, input to continuous maintenance tasks on the shop floor can be assisted. CPS, vision based inspection or AR solutions in the production environment provides the opportunity to detect fault in order to prescribe a possible maintenance solutions. The vision inspection as decision-making system may give feedback on detected problems, like contrast of parts, change in geometry, material or smutch on product or on the palette in production. This makes it possible to reduce interoperability and to make self-adjustments in production lines by use of CPS as a system for collaborating computational entities connected to services.",

      "Title": "Measure Theory-based Approach for Remaining Useful Lifetime Prediction in Power Converters",
      "Abstract": "It is well known that the reliability of each component in a power converter affects the reliability of the overall system. Due to the advancements in computing infrastructure and sensor technologies, data-driven approaches for the prediction of the health of power converters in real-time are slowly becoming popular. This paper proposes a new statistical approach using probability density functions (PDFs) and associated concepts in measure theory to predict the probability of system failure using individual components' degradation data. For this purpose, remaining-useful-life (RUL) is estimated for each power component (or sub-system) using qualification data, followed by an evaluation of a cumulative probability of survival for the converter. An artificial neural network (ANN) is then trained to quickly estimate in real-time, the probability of survival of the power converter in the future. While the algorithm involves multiple computation steps, the RUL prediction accuracy using the proposed method will be high due to the data-driven approach. Moreover, the machine learning-based model resulting from this approach to predict the probability of survival is light on memory utilization. It is envisioned that this approach can be used to create digital twins of power converters in practical circuits, optimize performance, and predict RUL. This paper explains the theory followed by an example analysis of an isolated DC-DC converter. An experimental qualification setup for device degradation test and system-level RUL measurement methods are provided.",

      "Abstract": "The digital twin, a concept that aims to establish a real-time mapping between physical space and virtual space, can be used for real-time analysis, reliability assessment, predictive maintenance, and design optimization of products. This article presents an enabling technology named shape-performance integrated digital twin (SPI-DT) and takes a boom crane as an example to illustrate how to design the SPI-DT step by step for the structural analysis of complex heavy equipment. The SPI-DT contains different types of models, such as an analytical model, a numerical model, and an artificial intelligence (AI) model. In addition, it leverages multisource dynamic data obtained by placing different sensors at multiple measurement positions. In the SPI-DT, the AI model plays a central role, invoking the numerical model and sensor data as the input to predict the structural performance of key components of heavy equipment, while the analytical model analyzes the structure of noncritical components with sensor data as input. This significantly improves the computational efficiency of the digital twin used for the structural analysis of complex heavy equipment, making the digital twin computationally affordable, and thus can be used for the safety assessment and damage protection of the equipment in the operation, as well as the design optimization of next-generation products. Moreover, to visually demonstrate the models and data in the SPI-DT, a three-dimensional application used to display and record the shape and performance information in real time during the operation of the boom crane is developed.",

      "Abstract": "With the immense pressure to sustain competitive in European manufacturing, the strategy of digitalizing in this industry sector is indeed necessary. With the onset of new ICT technology and big data capabilities, the physical asset and data computation is integrated in manufacturing through Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). This strategy also denoted as Industry 4.0 will also improve the maintenance function significantly in manufacturing. In particular, maintenance planning will be more synchronized in production scheduling. The aim of this article is to develop an integrated planning (IPL) approach that synchronizes production and maintenance planning with predictive maintenance capability. The result in this article is based on a case study and simulation of manufacturing equipment. In particular, application of key performance indicators (KPIs) is shown to be essential when running the synchronizing mechanism in IPL. The scientific application of the case study is alignment of the IPL theory and new approach in maintenance planning. Furthermore, the application to practice is improved maintenance planning in IPL that increases a reliable plant capacity. It is concluded that the IPL approach should be considered to be a generic platform for manufacturing industry that should be demonstrated further in other manufacturing branches in Europe.",

      "Abstract": "With the advances in new-generation information technologies, especially big data and digital twin, smart manufacturing is becoming the focus of global manufacturing transformation and upgrading. Intelligence comes from data. Integrated analysis for the manufacturing big data is beneficial to all aspects of manufacturing. Besides, the digital twin paves a way for the cyber-physical integration of manufacturing, which is an important bottleneck to achieve smart manufacturing. In this paper, the big data and digital twin in manufacturing are reviewed, including their concept as well as their applications in product design, production planning, manufacturing, and predictive maintenance. On this basis, the similarities and differences between big data and digital twin are compared from the general and data perspectives. Since the big data and digital twin can be complementary, how they can be integrated to promote smart manufacturing are discussed.",

      "Abstract": "Programs such as Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things contain the promise of”intelligent production” with”smart services”. In fact, great advances have already been made in sensor technology and machine connectivity. Production plants continuously generate and communicate large amounts of data and have become”cyber-physical systems”. However, the task of gaining knowledge from these large amounts of data is still challenging. Data generated by numerical control (NC) and programmable logic controllers (NC) comes in a raw format that doesnt allow the application of analytical methods directly. Extensive preprocessing and feature engineering has to be applied to structure this data for further analysis. An important application is the timely detection of deviations in the production process which allows immediate reactions and adjustments of production parameters or indicates the necessity of a predictive maintenance action. In our research, we aimed at the identification of special deviant behavior of a grinding machine based on NC data. One finding wast the distinguishing the warm-up program from regular production and the other to recognize imprecise identification of the grinding process window. Both tasks could be solved with extensive preprocessing of the raw data, appropriate feature extraction and feature reduction, and the subsequent application of a clustering algorithm.",

      "Abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for implementation of a digital twin for condition monitoring of a small-scale knuckle boom crane. The digital twin of the crane is simulated real-time in a nonlinear finite element (FE) program, where the estimated payload weight is used as an input. We implement an inverse method for estimation of the weight as well as its force vector direction based on physical strain gauge measurements. Additional strain gauges were utilized for validation of accuracy of the digital twin and inverse method. Based on a few physical sensor outputs, the digital twin allows for real-time determination of stresses, strains and loads at an unlimited number of hot spots. Therefore a digital twin can be an effective tool for predictive maintenance and product life-cycle management. In addition, condition monitoring of cranes during heavy-lift operations increases safety and reliability. The presented approach is described in a general manner and is applicable for various robotic manipulators used in the industry.",

      "Abstract": "Industry 4.0 has evolved from a perception of smart factories to include value chain (i.e. manufacturing, production, logistics, supply chain and Internet of Things (IOT). Many companies are leading the transformation toward Industry 4.0 based on innovation by Cyber-Physical System (CPS). CPS Systems integrate computation, networking and physical processes that will provide new functionalities to improve quality of life and enable technological advances in critical areas. Besides CPS, transformative technologies impacting Industry 4.0 are Machine-to-machine learning, Big-Data analysis, Cloud computing, Mobile internet, Autonomous vehicles and advanced materials. Industry 4.0 is also influenced by extensive application of Enhanced Visualization and Simulation, Additive Manufacturing, Smart Automation and Augmented Reality. The combination of Internet technologies and future-oriented technologies in (machines & products) based on advanced digitalization results in a new fundamental paradigm shift in Industry. This paper includes a case study demonstrating the impact of Industry 4.0-including the integration of CPS in Human Balance and Rehabilitation Engineering. Growing health care needs have seen the introduction of Artificial intelligence and data science integrated into tele-sensing of vital signs. Sensory perception and model-based decision making has helped the study of human gait to assist in balance. This case study involves impaired populations involving stroke survivors, fall-prone elderly, vestibular loss sufferers and amputees using an ambulatory suspension system. The case study demonstrates the use of sensory perception, data collection and the use of body support system such as an Ambulatory Suspension System for decision making on balance. These technologies are reordering the global industry structure, creating new markets, products, improving labor productivity and driving growth in advanced economies. These technologies have enormous impacts on predictive maintenance, improved decision-making in real-time, real-time inventory and improved flexibility among jobs.",

      "Abstract": "Industry 4.0 is the current trend in the technologies used in exchange of data in manufacturing. Product-service system is a concept that provides self-aware and self-learning machines, and consequently improve overall performance and maintenance management. Companies continually strive to increase production, but in recent years, the effects of this effort have demonstrated that provision of products alone with less resilient technology-enabled service industry is insufficient to remain competitive. The importance of leveraging flexibility and capabilities offered by cloud computing is inevitable, but adapting prognostics and health management algorithms to efficiently implement current data management technologies was research and develop in this study. In this paper, we present an integrated product-service system as a potential concept from a life-cycle perspective to reduce disruption, costs and associated services such as autonomous maintenance, through exchange of data to understand equipment degradation using sensors application, to aid timely services intervention for manufacturing processes transformation. The results is the knowledge base servitude backed by machine clusters generated data for different working conditions to improve operational efficiency using Cloud IoT to connect, process, store, and analyse data on the dashboard, locally and in the cloud for future health assessment.",

      "Abstract": "Deep neural network based condition monitoring systems are used to detect system failures of cyber-physical production systems. However, a vulnerability of deep neural networks are adversarial examples. They are manipulated inputs, e.g. process data, with the ability to mislead a deep neural network into misclassification. Adversarial example attacks can manipulate the physical production process of a cyber-physical production system without being recognized by the condition monitoring system. Manipulation of the physical process poses a serious threat for production systems and employees. This paper introduces CyberProtect, a novel approach to prevent misclassification caused by adversarial example attacks. CyberProtect generates adversarial examples and uses them to retrain deep neural networks. This results in a hardened deep neural network with a significant reduced misclassification rate. The proposed countermeasure increases the classification rate from 20% to 82%, as proved by empirical results.",

      "Abstract": "As the teeth of CNC machine tools, cutting tools are of great importance to machining efficiency, quality, cost and energy consumption. Precise usage of cutting tools is believed to improve economic, environmental and social benefits greatly. However, the problem that the physical cutting tool was difficult to be reacted by modelling and simulation of its degradation process made the cutting tool usage, replacement and sharpening lack of reliable support, which affected optimization and control for precise usage of cutting tools and dynamic adjustment of machining system. Based on the concept of digital twin, a digital twin model for cutting tools in machining process was proposed, and its concept, structure, function and running procedure were investigated in detail. Digital twin-driven cutting tool wear condition monitoring, remaining useful life prediction, cutting tool selection decision-making and cutting service were also addressed deeply. A prototype was developed to illustrate and validate the model. Through interaction and fusion of physical cutting tools and virtual models, the digital twin model for cutting tools in machining process enabled an intelligent, proactive and predictive cutting tool management mode to support optimization, decision-making and service.",

Especially, the machinery industry significantly benefits from these automation techniques in machine-tool quality inspection, cutting-tool remaining-useful-life, surface roughness prediction, etc. However, these innovation technologies are still not executable in the aerospace-component production due to their complex machining conditions, which result in long metrology delays and severe component deformations. To overcome these two challenges of the aerospace industry, this letter proposes to apply the automatic virtual metrology (AVM) system to successfully convert sampling inspections with metrology delay into real-time and online total inspection and to utilize the so-called deformation fusion (DF) scheme for dealing with the component-deformation problem. The application of the flange operation of aerospace engine-case manufacturing is adopted to illustrate the performance of the AVM-plus-DF approach.",

      "Abstract": "The paper presents an approach for the retrofitting of industrial looms on the shop floor of a textile industry. This is a real case study, where there was a need to update the equipment, providing the machines with communication features aligned with the concept of Industry 4.0. The work was developed within the scope of the research project PRODUTECH-SIF: Solutions for the Industry of the Future. Temperature, Inductive, Acoustic and 3-axis Accelerometers sensors were installed in different parts of the machines for monitorization. Data acquisition and processing is done by a SmarBox developed on a cRIO 9040 from National Instruments. A SmartBox processes data from one to four looms, allowing these old machines to have communication capacity and to be monitored remotely through the factory plant’s MES/ERP. Communication can be done through the OPC UA or MQTT architecture, both protocols aligned with the new trends for industrial communications. The sensor data will be used to feed production and manufacturing KPIs and for predictive maintenance. The approach presented in this paper allows industries with legacy equipment to renew and adapt to new market trends, improving productivity rates and reduced maintenance costs.",

      "Abstract": "Industrie 4.0 has been becoming one of the most challenging topic areas in industrial production engineering within the last decade. The increasing and comprehensive digitization of industrial production processes allows the introduction of innovative data-driven business models using cyber-physical systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT). Efficient and flexible manufacturing of goods assumes that all involved production systems are capable of fulfilling all necessary machining operations in the desired quality. To ensure this, production systems must be able to communicate and interact with machines and humans in a distributed environment, to monitor the wear condition of functionally relevant components, and to self-adapt their behaviour to a given situation. This article gives an overview about the historical development of intelligent production systems in the context of value-adding business models. The focus is on condition monitoring and predictive maintenance in an availability oriented business model. Technical as well as organizational prerequisites for an implementation in the production industry are critically analysed and discussed on the basis of best practice examples. The paper concludes with a summary and an outlook on future research topics that should be addressed.",

      "Title": "Resilient Design and Operation of Cyber Physical Systems with Emphasis on Unmanned Autonomous Systems",
      "Abstract": "Autonomy and autonomous systems are occupying central stage in the research community, as autonomous vehicles are proliferating and their utility in all aspects of the military and civilian domains are increasing exponentially from one year to the next. The development and application of resiliency and safety technologies to autonomous systems is, unfortunately, not keeping pace with their growth rate. Several factors impede the deployment and adoption of autonomous systems. Among them is the absence of an adequately high level of autonomy that can be relied upon, significant challenges in the area of human-machine interface requiring significant human intervention to operate and interpret sensor data, the need for emerging machine learning technologies and, most importantly, the resilient design and operation of complex systems to assure their safety, reliability and availability when executing missions in unstructured and cluttered environments. Recent advances in resiliency and safety of complex engineered systems have focused on methods/tools to tradeoff system performance for increased time to failure aiming at mission completion or trial and error methods to arrive at a suboptimal policy for system self-organization in the presence of a failure mode. This paper introduces a novel framework for the resilient design and operation of such complex systems via self-organization and control reconfiguration strategies that avoid empirical trial and error techniques and may be implemented and perform in real time on-platform. The main theme is summarized as: “a healthy and resilient system is a safe system”. To accomplish this objective, we introduce an integrated and rigorous approach to resilient design while safety considerations ascertain that the targeted system is contained within a safe envelope. A resilient system is robustly and flexibly monitoring its internal and external environment, it can detect and anticipate disturbances that may affect its operational integrity and take appropriate action to compensate for the disturbance. Resilience enhances safety while improving risk factors and assures that vehicles subjected to extreme disturbances remain within their safe envelope. The enabling technologies begin with graph spectral and epidemic spreading modeling tools to represent the system behaviors under normal and faulty conditions; a Markov Decision Process is the basic self-organization module. We are introducing a novel approach to fault-tolerance by considering the impacts of severe fault modes on system performance as inputs to a Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategy that trades off system performance with control activity in order to extend the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the unmanned system. Performance metrics are defined and assist in the algorithmic developments and their validation. We pursue an integrated and verifiable methodology to safety assurance that enables the evaluation of the effectiveness of risk management strategies. Several unmanned autonomous systems are used for demonstration purposes.",

      "Abstract": "Digital Twin technology is emerging as the digitization platform to enhance the industrial information processing and management in concern with virtual and physical entities. It paves the path for integrated industrial data analysis by combining IoT and Artificial Intelligence for better data interpretation. At present in oil industry, pipelines prevail to be feasible mode, the risk probability rate is getting increased and maintenance system becomes difficult with attention to the earlier prediction of accidents risks by undertaking entire pipeline. This paper aims to provide the frame structure of Digital Twin based on machine learning and prognostics algorithms model to analyze and predict the risk probability rate of oil pipeline system. Prognostics focuses on the detection of a failure precursor by estimating risk condition with respect to the pressure data towards the evaluation of remaining useful life (RUL). The abnormality of pressure attribute is taken in prognostic analysis for risk probability estimation followed by Dirichlet Process Clustering and Canopy clustering to segregate the abnormal pressure drop and rise. Using multiple oil substation data integration platform, the features are extracted using manifold learning methods and the best feature probability rates are evaluated using kernel based SVM algorithm to provide on-time control action on the entire oil pipeline system through efficient wireless data communication between server and the oil substations. As a result, the proposed work creates Virtual Intelligent Integrated Automated Control System to predict the risk rate in oil industry by integrating entire transmission lines through enhanced wireless information networks in remote locations.",

      "Abstract": "As the emerging digitalization of technical systems offers immense opportunities to be exploited by means of big data analysis, ubiquitous computing and largely networked systems, the digital twin comes into focus to combine all these aspects to an attendant model of an individual system during design phase as well as during operation. Since state-of-art technical systems are growing increasingly complex due to inherent intelligence and increasing functionality, i. e. autonomous behavior so far, it becomes considerably challenging to ensure reliability for those systems. Many methods were developed to support a reliability focused design or reliability-by-design approaches to tackle this challenge during design process. In field, data-based methods, i. e. condition monitoring enabled by the rise of machine learning approaches, are exploited to ensure a reliable operation based on the current condition of the monitored system. In order to take advantage of existing models of system reliability during design phase and condition monitoring systems during operation, a method is proposed to combine both approaches in order to set up a digital twin with focus on system reliability. The base model of the digital twin is taken from the system reliability model from the design phase and is used during operation and therein updated to the current reliability based on the state estimation of the condition monitoring system. The approach is illustrated with a case study of a rolling bearing test rig.",

      "Abstract": "Transport systems incorporating linear synchronous motors (LSMs) enable linear motion at high speed for emerging factory automation applications. The goal of this work is to determine the feasibility of harvesting energy directly from an operational LSM transport system employed in high volume manufacturing. Microelectromechanical (MEMs) based sensor technology, deployed as part of a wireless cyber physical system (CPS), perform near real-time magnetic field measurement for a mobile LSM vehicle. The vehicle under study is purposed for mobile factory automation and is not wired for communications nor does it have an onboard power source. A series of experiments were designed and conducted to establish the magnetic profile of the system. Empirical data capture was conducted on a cycled LSM test-bed comprising of 2 shuttles and 2 x 3 meter lengths of LSM track (MagneMotion QuickStick®100). Varying vehicle speeds were incorporated in the experimental regime to determine how changes in velocity would impact the magnetic profile of the vehicle. The recorded magnetic field data was analysed and a relationship between LSM vehicle speed and magnetic field frequency was established. The study highlights the potential to employ a single receiving coil to enable energy recovery which in turn could power a cyber-physical system (CPS) tasked with performing condition based monitoring of the LSM transport vehicles. This in turn can form the basis for the development of a predictive maintenance system, deployed to an LSM based transport layer in high volume manufacturing environments.",

      "Title": "The use of high-performance fatigue mechanics and the extended Kalman / particle filters, for diagnostics and prognostics of aircraft structures",
      "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose an approach for diagnostics and prognostics of damaged aircraft structures, by combing high-performance fatigue mechanics with filtering theories. Fast & accurate deterministic analyses of fatigue crack propagations are carried out, by using the Finite Element Alternating Method (FEAM) for computing SIFs, and by using the newly developed Moving Least Squares (MLS) law for computing fatigue crack growth rates. Such algorithms for simulating fatigue crack propagations are embedded in the computer program Safe- Flaw, which is called upon as a subroutine within the probabilistic framework of filter theories. Both the extended Kalman as well as particle filters are applied in this study, to obtain the statistically optimal and semi-optimal estimates of crack lengths, from a series of noisy measurements of crack-lengths over time. For the specific problem, a simple modification to the particle filter, which can drastically reduce the computational burden, is also proposed. Based on the results of such diagnostic analyses, the prognostics of aerospace structures are thereafter achieved, to estimate the probabilistic distribution of the remaining useful life. By using a simple example of a single-crack near a fastener hole, we demonstrate the concept and effectiveness of the proposed framework. This paper thus forms the scientific foundation for the recently proposed concepts of VRAMS (Virtual Risk-Informed Agile Maneuver Sustainment) and Digital Twins of aerospace vehicles.",

Electromagnetic coils are fundamental energy conversion and transformation components of a variety of machines, such as electric motors and solenoid valves, and their insulation failure can cause catastrophic effects. Conversion of sensory data to insulation health information and development of a component/cyber-interface for integrating insulation health information to cyberspace are described.

Although the collection of large data sets can be used for many solutions, its utilization is made difficult by the increased overhead on the transmission and limited processing capabilities of the underlying physical system. For such highly correlated and extensive data, this situation is usually described as data-rich, information-poor. We propose for the first time a novel one-stage method, called Information-Abstraction-Net (IA-Net), for the detection of abnormal events in multi-object anomaly detection scenarios by utilizing highly abstracted sensory information instead of the entire sampled data set to elevate the transmission and analysis needs of the system. We find that the computation complexity of IA-Net is reduced by half compared to competing solutions and the detection accuracy is increased by about 5-47%, as well.",

      "Abstract": "Digital Twin is a new paradigm combining multiphysics modelling together with data-driven analytics. In recent years, it draws considerable interest from the oil and gas field operators due to lower oil prices to reduce the downtime due to planned or unplanned preventive maintenance in production field which cost several million in the operational cost (OPEX). The digital twin is an integrated system with low-cost IoT sensors to gather system data, advanced data analytics to draw meaningful insights and predictive maintenance strategy based on the machine learning algorithm to reduce preventive maintenance cost. Overall the digital twin act as a digital replica of the field asset which is monitored and maintained based on actual sensor data from the physical field using machine learning. This paper will demonstrate the conceptual design of a digital twin of subsea pipeline system integrating the computational model, field sensor data analytics and predictive maintenance based on the machine learning algorithm. The computational model is first developed in the finite element (FE) model and calibrated by the field sensor data installed on the physical system. The computational model will be used to predict any change of pipe behaviour due to sudden changes in loading due to high pressure, slugging or leak etc. The proposed digital twin model will assist the oil and gas field operators in minimizing the OPEX with predictive maintenance schedule when it's needed to avoid failure in the pipeline system.",

To improve the effect of predictive engine maintenance, the aero-engine predictive maintenance framework driven by digital twin (DT) is studied, and the implicit digital twin (IDT) model is mined. The validity of the model is verified by the consistency evaluation of virtual and real data assets. Combining the data-driven with LSTM model of deep learning method and taking an aero-engine as an example can show that the method is effective.

      "Abstract": "As a transmission component, the gear has been obtained widespread attention. The remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of gear is critical to the prognostics health management (PHM) of gear transmission systems. The digital twin (DT) provides support for gear RUL prediction with the advantages of rich health information data and accurate health indicators (HI). This paper reviews digital twin-driven RUL prediction methods for gear performance degradation, from the view of digital twin-driven physical model-based and virtual model-based prediction method. From the view of the physical model-based one, it includes a prediction model based on gear crack, gear fatigue, gear surface scratch, gear tooth breakage, and gear permanent deformation. From the view of the digital twin-driven virtual model-based one, it includes non-deep learning methods and deep learning methods. Non-deep learning methods include the wiener process, gamma process, hidden Markov model (HMM), regression-based model, and proportional hazard model. Deep learning methods include deep neural networks (DNN), deep belief networks (DBN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and recurrent neural networks (RNN). It mainly summarizes the performance degradation and life test of various models in gear and evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of various methods. In addition, it encourages future works.",

      "Abstract": "The rapid development forms a new transition of information technologies to offer an intelligent manufacturing. The manufacturer has revolutionized the stages of product lifecycle including process planning and maintenance for the early detection of potential system failures and proactive management. Technological advancements including big data, the cloud, and the Internet of Things have applied digital-twin for industrial practice. It has low-power wireless-enabled devices to play a vital role in various industrial automation systems such as industry logistics, portable equipment, and intelligent wireless monitoring. It is evident that industrial manufacturers are nowadays aiming to transform the machine into fully automated systems that not only control the operation of the equipment but also try to meet the demand of future markets effectively. One of the challenging issues in the automation of the machinery process is the deployment of reliable systems to analyze the machinery condition such as fault diagnosis. Thus, this article proposes a digital-twin-assisted fault diagnosis using deep transfer learning to analyze the operational conditions of machining tools. Moreover, this proposed system has developed an intelligent tool-holder that integrates a k-type thermocouple and cloud data acquisition system over the WiFi module. The analytical study proves that this intelligent tool-holder provides better accuracy to demonstrate the optimization of milling and drilling operations of cutting tools.",

      "Abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is escalating in data-driven condition monitoring research. Traditional expert knowledgebased Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) processes can be smartened up with the assistance of various AI techniques, such as deep learning models. On the other hand, current deep learning based prognostics suffers from the data deficit issue, especially considering the varying operating conditions and the degradation modes of the components in practical industrial applications. With the development of simulation techniques, physical-knowledge based digital twin models give engineers access to a large amount of simulation data at a lower cost. These simulation data contain the physical characteristics and the degradation information of the component. In order to accurately predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) during the degradation process, in this paper, a bearing digital twin model is constructed based on a phenomenological vibration model. A Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) is used to achieve the domain adaptation target between the simulation and the real data. Regarding the simulation data as the source domain and the real data as the target domain, the DANN model is able to predict the RUL without any priori knowledge of the labelling information. Based on the validation results from real bearing run-to-failure experiments, the proposed method is able to get the minimum RUL prediction error compared against state-of-the-art methods.",

However, the production companies' internal structures and processes must also meet these flexibility requirements in order for system adjustments to be efficiently carried out. Due to the direct influence on availability, performance and quality losses, maintenance is particularly relevant. Therefore, this paper considers the effects of flexibility on the promising strategy of predictive maintenance. With the digital twin, its update service and a labelling interface, the essential components of a predictive maintenance system for flexible production systems are introduced in detail. This application is based on a reference plant in the form of a flexible hybrid assembly system. The outlook discusses the transferability to other industrial use cases.",

This paper describes the building of an Industry 4.0-compliant lab environment, which consists of a service-oriented shop floor (OT level) and three major management systems: an ERP system; a database; and a simulation for predictive maintenance (IT level). The architecture of the system follows the ISA'95 standard enterprise architecture, e.g. by assigning the components of the system to the corresponding levels of the ISA'95 model. A middleware acts as a common interface between these systems. Basic requirements for this middleware are interfaces to the lower level systems via OPC-UA and upper level systems by accessing a database. The middleware should be translated the data follows soft real-time requirements.

      "Abstract": "The transformation of the common production plant to a cyber-physical system is one of the most recent developments in manufacturing industry. The analysis of data streams produced by such sensor-equipped plants promises potential for process optimization. However, for competitive reasons and due to the novelty of the development, the access to publicly available real-world data is quite limited. Hence, businesses and researchers new to this area are often confronted with the cumbersome and complex task of synthesizing time series in order to gain first experiences. This work presents a novel concept and a corresponding software implementation for the stream-wise generation and publication of sensor data, to simulate condition monitoring of industrial production plants. The resulting configuration file-driven tool is capable of acting like a sensor-equipped plant by generating data points from various Gaussian Process-based models and mathematical expressions, or by replaying data sets. Moreover, it can be seamlessly connected with existing surrounding systems by using the MQTT protocol. In this context, the software aims at laying the foundation for real-world applications and improving them by providing a simulation tool to prototype and test with.",

The purpose of the CPFS is to improve the fixture-workpiece stability and thus to prevent deformations of the machined thin-wall workpiece by controlling the simulated clamping and reaction forces at locators. An equilibrium analysis is employed to model and simulate the behaviour of the fixture-workpiece system with respect to the actual cutting tool position. The simulation is incorporated with an optimization routine to minimize the clamping and locating forces. The smart fixture condition monitoring system is developed by connecting the machine tool to the simulation resources in the fixturing platform which performs instant fixture condition monitoring based on signal processing, cutting force signal feature extraction, fixture layout simulations, clamping forces optimization, simulation of clamping/locating forces and process corrective control actions. A prismatic workpiece with slot milling operation is considered to validate the proposed CPFS system.",

      "Title": "Ensemble trees learning based improved predictive maintenance using IIoT for turbofan engines",
      "Abstract": "An unprecedented growth of the industrial sector, has led to an exponential increase in the amount of industrial IoT (IIoT) data. This is sprouting increased interest in the data-driven predictive maintenance (PDM) of the industrial equipments in cyber-physical systems (CPS). PDM is a prominent strategy which can achieve increased reliability and safety of CPS while attaining reduced maintenance cost by estimating the current health status and the remaining user life (RUL). In modern days, schedule-based airline maintenance does not consider prediction of faults in advance, which may result in undue maintenance situations where components are still kept in service even though they might have exceeded their defined limit of failure. Therefore, accurate degradation assessment and RUL prediction makes sense on dual fronts of guiding sensible decision-making regarding aviation safety and rational maintenance. To identify most crucial attributes and critical relationship among the attributes for fault detection of individual equipment(s) in the turbofan aircraft engine, We propose a predictive maintenance model using data-driven prognostic method for RUL estimation with multiple operating conditions. we capture increased insight using improved feature engineering and apply ensemble tree learning. Extensive experiments are performed on a widely used Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) C-MAPSS dataset. It is observed that Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) with an accuracy of 93.91% performs better over Random Forest (RF) with 91.78% accuracy. However RF performed competitively with a much faster compute time in comparison to GBT.",

      "Abstract": "Research on scheduling problems is an evergreen challenge for industrial engineers. The growth of digital technologies opens the possibility to collect and analyze great amount of field data in real-time, representing a precious opportunity for an improved scheduling activity. Thus, scheduling under uncertain scenarios may benefit from the possibility to grasp the current operating conditions of the industrial equipment in real-time and take them into account when elaborating the best production schedules. To this end, the article proposes a proof-of-concept of a simheuristics framework for robust scheduling applied to a Flow Shop Scheduling Problem. The framework is composed of genetic algorithms for schedule optimization and discrete event simulation and is synchronized with the field through a Digital Twin (DT) that employs an Equipment Prognostics and Health Management (EPHM) module. The contribution of the EPHM module inside the DT-based framework is the real time computation of the failure probability of the equipment, with data-driven statistical models that take sensor data from the field as input. The viability of the framework is demonstrated in a flow shop application in a laboratory environment.",

      "Abstract": "The main drivers for the development and evolution of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are the reduction of development costs and time along with the enhancement of the designed products. The aim of this survey paper is to provide an overview of different types of system and the associated transition process from mechatronics to CPS and cloud-based (IoT) systems. It will further consider the requirement that methodologies for CPS-design should be part of a multi-disciplinary development process within which designers should focus not only on the separate physical and computational components, but also on their integration and interaction. Challenges related to CPS-design are therefore considered in the paper from the perspectives of the physical processes, computation and integration respectively. Illustrative case studies are selected from different system levels starting with the description of the overlaying concept of Cyber Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). The analysis and evaluation of the specific properties of a sub-system using a condition monitoring system, important for the maintenance purposes, is then given for a wind turbine.",

These are the components of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, characterized by functional and geographic decentralization. Traditional architectures through which data is collected include IoT devices that can transmit raw measurements values from a heterogeneous distributed network to a Cloud platform for high-level storage, analysis and processing. By improving the overall data distribution across the network, one can manage shortcomings generated by high latency and storage cost of the traditional Cloud Computing architecture. A particular use case for such implementation can be applied in the industrial environment. The new concept of Industry 4.0, an interplay of IoT and cyber-physical systems (CPS), is based, among others, on decentralized networks for data manipulation. Fog Computing can be synergistically coupled with the local control layer in a nonintrusive manner in order to provide performance information upload to the Cloud level. The article presents a framework architecture for data monitoring in an industrial environment. The data is used for predictive maintenance and performance KPIs (key performance indicators) concerning a flexible assembly line.",

      "Title": "Generalized degradation model for health management of mission critical systems",
      "Abstract": "In modern cyber physical energy systems, the time of the failure is typically determined utilizing a degradation model derived from measurements of critical parameters of relevance to the system. Developing an accurate model for the degradation process is a key challenge in prognostic and health management of such systems. A unified degradation framework has yet not been developed due to: (i) structural uncertainties in the state dynamics of the system and (ii) complex nature of the degradation process that is often non-linear and difficult to model statistically. The paper combines the multiple model adaptive estimation framework (MMAE) with degradation analysis to derive a set of candidate degradation models for failure prediction. Each degradation model is used to perform state analysis of the system. The resulting innovations and likelihoods are then integrated to compute a set of adaptive weights, one for each degradation model. With each update of the estimates obtained from the degradation models, the process is updated to account for the dynamic nature of the cyber physical system.The scope of this paper includes a new degradation modeling approach, state estimation, and an example application in cyber-physical energy systems.",

The digital twin of shearers was constructed based on multi-physical parameters of physical space, and the health state early prognosis of shearers was realized by visual display and analysis in virtual space. A prediction model of RUL of shearer key parts was established based on deep learning, and the online RUL prediction of parts driven by real-time monitoring data was realized. The prediction of shearer health was obtained based on the status of digital twin and the value of RUL. Finally, the effectiveness of the method was verified by experiments, which provides a new idea for the monitoring and management of the health status of the shearers.",

Subsequently, this co-existence of the real and digital twins poses a continuous interoperability issue between the physical and digital world. While in theory, the mapping of e.g. physical to digital properties is trivial, in practice, it usually is not.

      "Title": "Towards a digital twin for mitigating void formation during debulking of autoclave composite parts",
      "Abstract": "High-performance polymeric composites are increasingly used in the design of aircraft structural components; however, susceptibility to manufacturing irregularities, including porosity/voids, remains a primary challenge delaying the implementation of advanced composites in modern aircraft. Voids may be precursors to structural damage significantly affecting structural integrity and remaining useful life of the aircraft. High-performance aerospace composite parts are commonly manufactured from resin-saturated pre-impregnated plies of uncured material laid-up over a rigid tool and consolidated and cured in an autoclave. In many applications, especially in thick and curved composite sections common in aerospace designs, autoclave consolidation alone is not sufficient to remove the air, or bulk, that might have been entrapped within the laminate during the layup process. Vacuum consolidation, or “debulking”, has been a standard practice extensively used by manufacturers to reduce the amount of bulk prior to autoclave curing. The debulking process typically takes a long time and requires intensive manual operations. The underlying physical principles governing the formation and evolution of voids during these early stages of the manufacturing process are not yet well understood, and controlling parameters remain largely determined empirically or based on prior experience. Driven by the need to improve such understanding, there has been a recent interest in using newly available high-fidelity non-destructive inspection (NDI) techniques, such as X-ray Computed Tomography, for in situ observations of composites internal structure during the early stages of manufacturing. In situ observations are allowing researchers to identify the driving mechanisms involved during defect formation and develop improved predictive models. The objective of this work is to show that high-fidelity NDI data and new developments in numerical modeling can be combined to create a Digital Twin for mitigation of void formation in composite parts. In particular, X-ray CT data is used to extract bulk content and distribution in uncured carbon-epoxy curved-beam specimens after manual layup, and such information is transferred into a finite element (FE) model for simulation of debulking. The FE model uses a fracture-based approach that relies on pore-pressure cohesive zone modeling recently proposed for the discrete representation of entrapped air pockets in uncured resin-saturated prepregs. Preliminary results support a promising ability of the Digital Twin concept for optimizing the debulking process of autoclave composites towards mitigating void formation.",

      "Abstract": "In the field of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), the early detection of anomalies is crucial to avoid future faulty behaviors, e.g. preventing downtimes or decreasing product qualities. As a solution, unsupervised machine learning can be used to learn models of the historic system behavior and consequentially detect deviations from these models. Since CPS data are high dimensional time series, suitable approaches such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks are good solution candidates.CPSs have specific requirements for such machine learning algorithms. Learned models must be especially useful in closed control loops, i.e. without human supervision. For this, it is essential that the uncertainty about model predictions is also part of the learned models. In order to incorporate such uncertainties, we modify the mean squared error loss function used by LSTM. This paper also analyses the solution on artificial and real data.",

      "Title": "Recent progress on reliability analysis of offshore wind turbine support structures considering digital twin solutions",
      "Abstract": "Global wind energy has developed rapidly in recent years, and the offshore wind turbines (OWTs) have been applied to much more applications. Because the support structure of an OWT is prone to damage, it is crucial to strengthen the structural reliability to prevent unexpected failures and reduce operation costs by performing fault diagnosis, remaining useful life prediction, and condition-based maintenance. Through real-time monitoring on the operating status of the OWT support structures, the operation measurements can be obtained to detect initial structural cracks and predict the crack propagation to assess potential risks and perform just-in-time maintenance; as a result, the turbine downtime and maintenance costs can be significantly reduced and the wind turbine service life can be prolonged. This paper introduces the latest progress on the reliability analysis of the OWT support structures. First of all, the types of the support structures are reviewed; then, the reliability research progress on the support structure is presented and the existing challenges are discussed. In light of the digital twin (DT) technology, a solution to existing challenging issues is proposed by introducing the DT into the OWT support structures. This new DT framework will enable real-time monitoring, fault diagnosis and operation optimization of the OWT support structures, which may provide a useful application prospect in the reliability analysis of the OWT support structures in the future.",

      "Abstract": "The vision of pervasive applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and the fact that hardware is becoming more portable and computationally powerful has encouraged the development of industrial AI. High-speed railway (HSR) transportation is an area of focus for industrial AI, since it demands maximized safety, reliability, availability, and minimized cost. Given the system complexity, the predictive maintenance for high-speed railway could hardly sustain with a raw experience-based system. This paper presents a framework for industrial AI enabled PHM system for HSR, which creates cyber twins of physical key subsystems and components to improve the condition transparency and decision efficiency. Enabled by advanced signal processing and machine learning with domain insights on historical data, cyber twins monitor real-time performance and predict potential faults to prevent unexpected downtime and support optimized decisions. Instead of performing analytics with large amount of raw data on the cloud, the cyber railway transportation system leverages the advantage of edge computing for real-time feature extraction and anomaly detection. The proposed framework introduces the general approach of implementing industrial AI. The paper also discusses the key methods of data-driven solutions for selected critical subsystems.",

      "Abstract": "This book introduces Industrial AI in multiple dimensions. Industrial AI is a systematic discipline which focuses on developing, validating and deploying various machine learning algorithms for industrial applications with sustainable performance. Combined with the state-of-the-art sensing, communication and big data analytics platforms, a systematic Industrial AI methodology will allow integration of physical systems with computational models. The concept of Industrial AI is in infancy stage and may encompass the collective use of technologies such as Internet of Things, Cyber-Physical Systems and Big Data Analytics under the Industry 4.0 initiative where embedded computing devices, smart objects and the physical environment interact with each other to reach intended goals. A broad range of Industries including automotive, aerospace, healthcare, semiconductors, energy, transportation, mining, construction, and industrial automation could harness the power of Industrial AI to gain insights into the invisible relationship of the operation conditions and further use that insight to optimize their uptime, productivity and efficiency of their operations. In terms of predictive maintenance, Industrial AI can detect incipient changes in the system and predict the remains useful life and further to optimize maintenance tasks to avoid disruption to operations.",

      "Abstract": "Electric mobility has become an essential part of the future of transportation. Detection, diagnosis and prognosis of fault in electric drives are improving the reliability, of electric vehicles (EV). Permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives are used in a large variety of applications due to their dynamic performances, higher power density and higher efficiency. In this study, health monitoring and prognosis of PMSM is developed by creating intelligent digital twin (i-DT) in MATLAB/ Simulink. An artificial neural network (ANN) and fuzzy logic are used for mapping inputs distance, time of travel of EV and outputs casing temperature, winding temperature, time to refill the bearing lubricant, percentage deterioration of magnetic flux to compute remaining useful life (RUL) of permanent magnet (PM). Health monitoring and prognosis of EV motor using i-DT is developed with two approaches. Firstly, in-house health monitoring and prognosis is developed to monitor the performance of the motor in-house. Secondly, Remote Health Monitoring and Prognosis Centre (RHMPC) is developed to monitor the performance of the motor remotely using cloud communication by the service provider of the EV. The simulation results prove that the RUL of PM and time to refill the bearing lubricant obtained by i-DT twins theoretical results.",

      "Abstract": "An adaptive multi-tiered framework, that can be utilised for designing a context-aware cyber physical system to carry out smart data acquisition and processing, while minimising the amount of necessary human intervention is proposed and applied. The proposed framework is applied within the domain of offshore asset integrity assurance. The suggested approach segregates processing of the input stream into three distinct phases of Processing, Prediction and Anomaly detection. The Processing phase minimises the data volume and processing cost by analysing only inputs from easily obtainable sources using context identification techniques for finding anomalies in the acquired data. During the Prediction phase, future values of each of the gas turbine’s sensors are estimated using a linear regression model. The final step of the process— Anomaly Detection—classifies the significant discrepancies between the observed and predicted values to identify potential anomalies in the operation of the cyber physical system under monitoring and control. The evolving component of the framework is based on an Artificial Neural Network with error backpropagation. Adaptability is achieved through the combined use of machine learning and computational intelligence techniques. The proposed framework has the generality to be applied across a wide range of problem domains requiring processing, analysis and interpretation of data obtained from heterogeneous resources.",

An algorithm is proposed for the model identification, which receives the torsional response and estimated values of rotor and generator torques, and calculates the drivetrain dynamic properties, e.g. eigenvalues, and torsional model parameters. The applications of this model in prediction of gearbox remaining useful lifetime is discussed. The proposed method is computationally fast, and can be implemented by integrating with the current turbine control and monitoring system without a need for a new system and sensors installation.

      "Abstract": "The term smart manufacturing refers to a future-state of manufacturing, where the real-time transmission and analysis of data from across the factory creates manufacturing intelligence, which can be used to have a positive impact across all aspects of operations. In recent years, many initiatives and groups have been formed to advance smart manufacturing, with the most prominent being the Smart Manufacturing Leadership Coalition (SMLC), Industry 4.0, and the Industrial Internet Consortium. These initiatives comprise industry, academic and government partners, and contribute to the development of strategic policies, guidelines, and roadmaps relating to smart manufacturing adoption. In turn, many of these recommendations may be implemented using data-centric technologies, such as Big Data, Machine Learning, Simulation, Internet of Things and Cyber Physical Systems, to realise smart operations in the factory. Given the importance of machine uptime and availability in smart manufacturing, this research centres on the application of data-driven analytics to industrial equipment maintenance. The main contributions of this research are a set of data and system requirements for implementing equipment maintenance applications in industrial environments, and an information system model that provides a scalable and fault tolerant big data pipeline for integrating, processing and analysing industrial equipment data. These contributions are considered in the context of highly regulated large-scale manufacturing environments, where legacy (e.g. automation controllers) and emerging instrumentation (e.g. internet-aware smart sensors) must be supported to facilitate initial smart manufacturing efforts.",

The use of multi-agent systems has been shown to improve the ability to predict equipment failures by enabling machines with communication and collaborative learning capabilities. Different architectures have been postulated for industrial multi-agent systems in general. A rigorous analysis of the implications of their implementation for collaborative prognostics is essential to guide industrial deployment. In this paper, we investigate the cost and reliability implications of using different multi-agent systems architectures for collaborative failure prediction and maintenance optimization in large fleets of industrial assets. Results show that purely distributed architectures are optimal for high-value assets, while hierarchical architectures optimize communication costs for low-value assets. This enables asset managers to design and implement multi-agent systems for predictive maintenance that significantly decrease the whole-life cost of their assets.",

      "Abstract": "Emergent paradigms of Industry 4.0 and Industrial Internet of Things expect cyber-physical systems to reliably provide services overcoming disruptions in operative conditions and adapting to changes in architectural and functional requirements. In this paper, we describe a hardware/software framework supporting operation and maintenance of software-controlled systems enhancing resilience by promoting a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) process to automatically derive structural configurations and failure models from reliability artifacts. Specifically, a reflective architecture developed around digital twins enables representation and control of system Configuration Items properly derived from SysML Block Definition Diagrams, providing support for variation. Besides, a plurality of distributed analytic agents for qualitative evaluation over executable failure models empowers the system with runtime self-assessment and dynamic adaptation capabilities. We describe the framework architecture outlining roles and responsibilities in a System of Systems perspective, providing salient design traits about digital twins and data analytic agents for failure propagation modeling and analysis. We discuss a prototype implementation following the MDE approach, highlighting self-recovery and self-adaptation properties on a real cyber-physical system for vehicle access control to Limited Traffic Zones.",

The research is focused on identifying the role of AI in connected devices such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Through literature review, we identify wide ranging and creative methodologies for cyber analytics and explore the risks of deliberately influencing or disrupting behaviours to socio-technical systems. This resulted in the modelling of the connections and interdependencies between a system's edge components to both external and internal services and systems. We focus on proposals for models, infrastructures and frameworks of IoT systems found in both business reports and technical papers. We analyse this juxtaposition of related systems and technologies, in academic and industry papers published in the past 10 years. Then, we report the results of a qualitative empirical study that correlates the academic literature with key technological advances in connected devices. The work is based on grouping future and present techniques and presenting the results through a new conceptual framework. With the application of social science's grounded theory, the framework details a new process for a prototype of AI-enabled dynamic cyber risk analytics at the edge.",

      "Abstract": "Industry 4.0 has shifted the manufacturing related processes from conventional processes within one organization to collaborative processes across different organizations. For example, product design processes, manufacturing processes, and maintenance processes across different factories and enterprises. This complex and competitive collaboration requires the underlying system architecture and platform to be flexible and extensible to support the demands of dynamic collaborations as well as advanced functionalities such as big data analytics. Both operation and condition of the production equipment are critical to the whole manufacturing process. Failures of any machine tools can easily have impact on the subsequent value-added processes of the collaboration. Predictive maintenance provides a detailed examination of the detection, location and diagnosis of faults in related machineries using various analyses. In this context, this paper explores how the FIWARE framework supports predictive maintenance. Specifically, it looks at applying a data driven approach to the Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) model for machine condition and remaining useful life to support predictive maintenance using FIWARE framework in a modular fashion.",

      "Abstract": "Current food system evolved in a great degree because of the development of processing and food engineering technologies: people learned to bake bread long before the advent of agriculture; salting and smoking supported nomad lifestyles; canning allowed for longer military marches; etc. Food processing technologies went through evolution and significant optimization and currently rely on minor fraction of energy comparing with initial prototypes. Emerging processing technologies (high-pressure, pulsed electric fields, ohmic heating, ultrasound) and novel food systems (cultured biomass, 3-D bioprinting, cyber-physical chains) try to challenge the existing chains by developing potentially more nutritious and sustainable food solutions. However, new food systems rely on low technology readiness levels and estimation of their potential future benefits or drawbacks is a complex task mostly due to the lack of integrated data. The research is aimed for the development of conceptual guidelines of food production system structuring as cyber-physical systems. The study indicates that cyber-physical nature of modern food is a key for the engineering of more nutritious and sustainable paths for novel food systems. Implementation of machine learning methods for the collection, integration, and analysis of data associated with biomass production and processing on different levels from molecular to global, leads to the precise analysis of food systems and estimation of upscaling benefits, as well as possible negative rebound effects associated with societal attitude. Moreover, such data-integrated assessment systems allow transparency of chains, integration of nutritional and environmental properties, and construction of personalized nutrition technologies.",

      "Title": "Hardening Deep Neural Networks in Condition Monitoring Systems against Adversarial Example Attacks",
      "Abstract": "Condition monitoring systems based on deep neural networks are used for system failure detection in cyber-physical production systems. However, deep neural networks are vulnerable to attacks with adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are manipulated inputs, e.g. sensor signals, are able to mislead a deep neural network into misclassification. A consequence of such an attack may be the manipulation of the physical production process of a cyber-physical production system without being recognized by the condition monitoring system. This can result in a serious threat for production systems and employees. This work introduces an approach named CyberProtect to prevent misclassification caused by adversarial example attacks. The approach generates adversarial examples for retraining a deep neural network which results in a hardened variant of the deep neural network. The hardened deep neural network sustains a significant better classification rate (82% compared to 20%) while under attack with adversarial examples, as shown by empirical results.",

      "Abstract": "Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), including monitoring, diagnosis, prognosis, and health management, occupies an increasingly important position in reducing costly breakdowns and avoiding catastrophic accidents in modern industry. With the development of artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning (DL) approaches, the application of AI-enabled methods to monitor, diagnose and predict potential equipment malfunctions has gone through tremendous progress with verified success in both academia and industry. However, there is still a gap to cover monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis based on AI-enabled methods, simultaneously, and the importance of an open source community, including open source datasets and codes, has not been fully emphasized. To fill this gap, this paper provides a systematic overview of the current development, common technologies, open source datasets, codes, and challenges of AI-enabled PHM methods from three aspects of monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis.",

      "Abstract": "Manufacturing industry is at its most exciting times with digital revolution. Man, machine, material and tools have to co-ordinate with each other seamlessly to maximize efficiency in a mass production environment. Various theoretical models are in practice to measure efficiency of equipment, gauging, services, maintenance, etc. While all the theoretical models are quite accurate in their approach to measuring the activities, they lagging behind in the process of data collection. The data collection methods are manual and not accurate. In this paper, a model is arrived at to collect live data of production, rejection and idle time in a machine tool with the help of electronic sensors. Effort is made to enhance operator engagement by compelling the operator to feed data so that the data collection becomes closed loop. As all data are digital in nature, meaningful information is sent to the management through an Internet of Things platform. This paper focuses on the digital data flow from the shop floor to management through the Cyber Physical System, enabling smart manufacturing in a mass production environment. The proposed model has been implemented and validated in a mass production set-up, engaged in manufacturing plug shell components.",

      "Abstract": "A cloud-based manufacturing process monitoring framework for online smart diagnosis services has been developed with the aim of performing tool condition monitoring during machining of difficult-to-machine materials. The proposed architecture allows to share process monitoring tasks between different resources, which can be geographically dislocated and managed by actors with different competences and functions. Distributed resources with enhanced computation and data storage capability allow to improve the efficiency of tool condition diagnosis and enable more robust decision-making, exploiting large information and knowledge sharing. Diagnosis on tool conditions is offered as a cloud service, using an architecture where the computing resources in the cloud are connected to the physical manufacturing system realising a complex cyber-physical system using sensor and network communication. Based on sensorial data acquired at the factory level, smart online diagnosis on consumed tool life and tool breakage occurrence is carried out through knowledge-based algorithms and cognitive pattern recognition paradigms. On the basis of the cloud diagnosis, the local server activates the proper corrective action to be taken, such as tool replacement, process halting or parameters change, sending the right command to the machine tool control.",

      "Abstract": "Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technology developments in Cloud Manufacturing (CMfg) are challenging traditional business models, and adapting these is key to a sustainable competitive advantage. In parallel, pay-per-use strategies are being discussed as an enabler to future sustainable societies. The general benefits of CMfg services are clear, but to date the actual business implications from a service provider perspective have not been discussed. This article explores new business model opportunities based on the idea of providing CMfg as a completely new type of Product-Service Systems. Technology developments and business recommendations are defined, considering the proposed business model targets the manufacturing industry as a whole. Manufacturers make use of their spare capacity by purchasing time on networked equipment on a pay-per-use basis. This allows costs to be brought down, whilst creating new revenue streams. It also increases machine hosts’ competitiveness by reducing investment costs and enabling instant manufacturing scalability. CMfg is then classified into three levels of machine autonomy, arguing that as technology develops intermediaries may slowly integrate vertically and eventually replace manufacturers by completely autonomous equipment. The proposed business model presents both a first step and a baseline point of reference towards bridging the gap between advanced manufacturing technology and new business development in the context of I4.0 (Smart Manufacturing).",

      "Abstract": "The main purpose of predictive maintenance (PdM) is to reduce unscheduled downtime and consequently improve productivity and reduce production cost. PdM has been featured as a key theme of Industry 4.0. However, the traditional PdM system was only designed for a single tool; as such, the resources allocation will become extremely complicated when hundreds of tools are working together in a factory. A manageable hierarchy and various health indexes are required for factory-wide equipment maintenance. To solve the problem mentioned above, this paper proposes a factory-wide intelligent predictive maintenance system by applying the so-called cyber-physical agent and advanced manufacturing cloud of Things to fulfill the requirements of Industry 4.0, the baseline predictive maintenance scheme to accomplish the PdM functions, and the newly proposed health index hierarchy to supervise factory-wide equipment maintenance.",

      "Abstract": "Today, industries are compelled to manufacture the products of excellent quality to meet the ever-increasing consumer demands competitively. Hence, implementing Industry 4.0 is becoming essentially the new age solution for industrial operations. This study attempts to categorise the important technological enablers for the Indian manufacturing industry in implementing Industry 4.0. In this context, 14 selected and identified enablers, namely Visual Computing, Big Data, Product Life Cycle Management, Supply Chain, Top Level Management, Collaborative Productivity, Internet of Things, Horizontal and Vertical Integration, Mass Customisation, Cyber-Physical System, Additive Manufacturing, Professional Training and Development, Networked Manufacturing Systems and Operational Efficiency, are identified through the review of literature and expert’s opinion for implementing Industry 4.0. Interpretive structural modelling (ISM) methodology is employed to appreciate the mutual relationships among the identified enablers. Furthermore, contextual interactions among the enablers are established by brainstorming with experts. The identified 14 technological enablers are further classified as dependent and driving factors. Later, the validation of the factors is done by MICMAC analysis. The interactions amongst these enablers will help the manufacturing organisations to prioritise and administer these factors efficiently and effectively to reap benefits during the implementation of Industry 4.0. Therefore, this study analyses the enablers to implement Industry 4.0 in the manufacturing industries. Also, it develops an interpretive framework that will help understand the interdependence of the enablers.",

This paper investigates the impact of the implementation of Industry 4.0 with specific emphasis on digital transformation on the sustainability dimensions of European manufacturing industries. In doing so, we propose a framework to identify the implications of Industry 4.0 on the reconciliation of the firm’s existing and new dynamic capabilities, competencies, and market requirements to achieve sustainable competitive advantage. Using a multiple case research design, we study six European manufacturing companies, including aerospace manufacturing (AM) and electronic component and systems (ECS) manufacturing. The novelty of our study lies in developing a set of theoretical propositions that reveals interrelations between Industry 4.0, the dynamic capabilities of the firm and distinct dimensions of sustainability. Our findings show that the reconciliation of dynamic capabilities mediates the impact of Industry 4.0 on economic, environmental, and social aspects. The study provides insights to practitioners to strengthen their dynamic capabilities in order to achieve sustainability while implementing Industry 4.0. Moreover, the findings also facilitate investment decisions in Industry 4.0 projects.",

A great number of techniques and methods have emerged in the light of these advances allowing to have an accurate and knowledge about the systems’ condition evolution and remaining useful life. The advances are recognised as outcomes of an innovative discipline, nowadays discussed under the term of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). In order to analyse how maintenance will change using PHM, a conceptual model is proposed built upon three views. The model highlights: (i) how PHM may impact the definition of maintenance policies; (ii) how PHM fits within the condition-based maintenance; and (iii) how PHM can be integrated into reliability-centred maintenance programmes. The conceptual model is the research finding of this review note and helps to discuss the role of PHM in advanced maintenance systems.",

      "Abstract": "The emergence and continuing rise of cyber-physical systems (CPS) poses significant challenges and opportunities for production and logistics firms. In order to exploit the potential of CPS in the corporate context, it is essential to understand CPS applications from a holistic systems perspective. This service systems perspective creates an understanding of the processes, activities and the corresponding resources (participants, information, technologies). In order to expand the knowledge on the design of such service systems, this paper identifies CPS applications from industrial production and logistics and analyses their influence on processes, activities and resources. By combining related literature and interviews with specialists from both industries, the following four key challenges for the design of service systems were identified: (i) the challenge of ‘information management’, meaning the design and management of information flows and the related infrastructure; (ii) the collaboration management’ between the internal and external actors involved in the service system; (iii) the capability exploitation’ of CPS; and (iv) the ‘management of the increasing complexity’ of CPS-based service systems, which results from an extended resource base.",

      "Abstract": "The technological choices facing the manufacturing industry are vast and complex as the industry contemplates the increasing levels of digitization and automation in readiness for the modern competitive age. These changes broadly categorized as Industry 4.0, offer significant transformation challenges and opportunities, impacting a multitude of operational aspects of manufacturing organizations. As manufacturers seek to deliver increased levels of productivity and adaptation by innovating many aspects of their business and operational processes, significant challenges and barriers remain. The roadmap towards Industry 4.0 is complex and multifaceted, as manufacturers seek to transition towards new and emerging technologies, whilst retaining operational effectiveness and a sustainability focus. This study approaches many of these significant themes by presenting a critical evaluation of the core topics impacting the next generation of manufacturers, challenges and key barriers to implementation. These factors are further evaluated via the presentation of a new Industry 4.0 framework and alignment of I4.0 themes with the UN Sustainability Goals.",

      "Abstract": "The impact of digitalisation and Industry 4.0 on the ripple effect and disruption risk control analytics in the supply chain (SC) is studied. The research framework combines the results from two isolated areas, i.e. the impact of digitalisation on SC management (SCM) and the impact of SCM on the ripple effect control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that connects business, information, engineering and analytics perspectives on digitalisation and SC risks. This paper does not pretend to be encyclopedic, but rather analyses recent literature and case-studies seeking to bring the discussion further with the help of a conceptual framework for researching the relationships between digitalisation and SC disruptions risks. In addition, it emerges with an SC risk analytics framework. It analyses perspectives and future transformations that can be expected in transition towards cyber-physical SCs. With these two frameworks, this study contributes to the literature by answering the questions of (1) what relations exist between big data analytics, Industry 4.0, additive manufacturing, advanced trace & tracking systems and SC disruption risks; (2) how digitalisation can contribute to enhancing ripple effect control; and (3) what digital technology-based extensions can trigger the developments towards SC risk analytics.",

      "Title": "Blockchain-enabled digital twin collaboration platform for heterogeneous socialized manufacturing resource management",
      "Abstract": "Social manufacturing is conceptualised as a new type of networked manufacturing paradigm that supports the organisation of socialised manufacturing resources (SMRs) to satisfy the growth of personalised demands on crowd intelligence in a timely manner when co-creating open architecture products. The high participation of each stakeholder in this type of product production places a higher requirement on sufficient collaboration among social, cyber and physical spaces. However, under a decentralised social manufacturing network, the management of SMRs has encountered some real-life challenges in terms of their distributed and heterogeneous features. Hence, this paper proposes a blockchain-enabled digital twin collaboration platform (BcDTCP) as an integrated solution to address these challenges. A hybrid domain-driven design method is presented to design and implement business-knowledge driven systems. To address the heterogeneity of SMRs, a ubiquitous object structure is designed to flexibly adjust the functionality of the digital twin. Blockchain is introduced to construct a peer-to-peer network to organise the SMRs in a decentralised manner. Additionally, a timed coloured Petri net-based workflow is adopted to formulise the collaboration logic into a smart contract executed on the blockchain. Finally, a demonstrative case study is conducted to verify and evaluate the proposed BcDTCP under a 3D printing scenario.",

      "Abstract": "There has been little discussion about solving problems in response to the Industry 4.0 challenge to a developing country. This paper focuses on those problems, including the investment dilemma caused by low affordability market, low capability of firms, and the fragmented stakeholder problem, in responding to the Industry 4.0 challenge. We develop a framework for solving the problems in responding to the Industry 4.0 challenge in Thailand, having frugal innovation and leapfrogging innovation concepts as theoretical bases. The examples of frugal and or leapfrogging innovation scenarios, which could offer a new momentum of the dynamics of industrial growth, which can be implemented under private–public partnership, are briefly discussed, and the pilot results of exposure of scenarios to Thai experts are discussed. The implication is that firms and developing countries need to consider alternative innovation approaches including the ones suggested and other possible approaches, and serious experimentation is required and the policy direction needs to be found out from feedbacks of the experimentations.",

      "Abstract": "Machine tools play a pivotal role in the manufacturing world since their performance significantly affects the product quality and production efficiency. In the era of Industry 4.0, machine tools are expected to have a higher level of accessibility, connectivity, intelligence, adaptivity, and autonomy. With the rapid development and application of various Industry 4.0 technologies, digitalisation and servitisation of machine tools have become a new research trend. However, few review articles on the development of machine tools in the context of Industry 4.0 have been reported. To understand the current status of digitalisation and servitisation of machine tools, this paper provides a systematic literature review combining both bibliometric and qualitative analysis. Our review results provide a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of recent advancements of digitalisation and servitisation of machine tools, including the key enabling technologies, methods, standards, architectures, and applications. Furthermore, we propose a novel conceptual framework of Cyber-Physical Machine Tool (CPMT) as a systematic approach to achieving digitalisation and servitisation of next-generation machine tools. Finally, major research issues, challenges, and future research directions are discussed. This work will help researchers and industrial practitioners spark new ideas for developing the next-generation machine tools in the era of Industry 4.0.",

The in-shop service module uses artificial intelligence to provide customers with quality experience. In the intelligent logistics module, the cyber-physical system (CPS) is used to conduct cloud processing of the traffic big data, aiming to provide an efficient intelligent logistics module for the transport of facial mask products to minimise transport time and costs. The entire process is highly efficient and fully intelligent in providing customers with customised facial mask production and services. As a result, it could be used by any Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in this business and thus provides still another innovative application of smart CPS in production coordination and logistics management in the era of Industry 4.0 and Web 2.0.",

      "Abstract": "The general concept of MANTIS project is to provide a proactive maintenance service platform architecture that allows to monitor essential system parameters and schedule maintenance in order to predict and prevent imminent failures. Human–machine interaction (HMI) is an important integral part of the platform by providing the right information in the right modality to the users when needed. As MANTIS comprises 11 distinct industrial use cases, the design of such HMI presents a great challenge. The framework presented in this paper originates from the scenario-based design and can be treated as a part of the overall scenario-based usability engineering approach. The framework has been conceived from an extensive list of HMI features extracted from the descriptions of use-case scenarios provided by each industrial partner. Due to the broad range of representative industry environments including production asset maintenance, vehicle maintenance, energy production management and health equipment maintenance we believe that the resulting HMI framework can be applied in different cases in practice and the paper would also be of general interest to the readers.",

A lack of empirical studies creates the need for academic contributions on the critical success factors of Industry 4.0 implementations and their resultant improvements for manufacturing businesses. This research uses case studies of eight implementations of Industry 4.0 technologies in Italy to supplement existent literature. An original data set was constructed using a purposely defined research protocol using plant visits and structured interviews. Continuous improvement/lean management emerged as a critical success factor for implementation, together with quality and flexibility-based competition, top management leadership, establishment of inter-functional teams, conducting of preparatory activities, project planning and training activities. Incremental/evolutionary and radical/revolutionary improvements in business model elements are possible outcomes of implementations, while addressing customers’ needs emerges as an antecedent to radical/revolutionary improvements. Managers will benefit from understanding how to achieve successful implementations and business improvements.",

      "Abstract": "The study of scheduling procedures has generated important contributions to the improvement of productivity in different industrial branches. In recent years, the incorporation of high technology to production systems brought the advent of a ‘fourth industrial revolution’, Industry 4.0. One of the mainstays of Industry 4.0 is the application of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), which are physical production systems that incorporate sophisticated computational tools. This implies embedding computers, enabling a real-time connection between workstations and Decision Support Systems. It seems natural, in this setting, to associate scheduling schemes to CPS. This allows streamlining the decision-making process, allowing more flexible and lean production lines. We review here the most salient contributions on scheduling in these environments. We distinguish between work on the basic issues of scheduling and that on scheduling as part of higher-level production planning activities. To frame correctly this distinction we analyse how CPS can embody the different levels of the ISA-95 structure and how this relates to the classical structure of production planning. Our review suggests that the real-time availability of information will have a significant impact in this area and that scheduling will be solved in the future in decentralised decision processes.",

      "Abstract": "This paper discusses the value proposition of a system-level Digital Twin (DT) in the context of complex manufacturing processes from the managerial perspective. The central promise of DT-technology is to use and iterate the available real-time process information in a simulation setting transforming it instantly to operational or managerial-level decision-making implications. Despite the clear potential of this emerging technology, a gap of knowledge exists on how such DT could be implemented and what would be its defining features. The key contribution of this research is to lay out the central discrepancies between the promise of digital twin technology vision versus what is possible within the limits of current industrial infrastructure in the short- and mid-term. This research builds on the currently existing scientific literature which we use to point out ten foundational issues of system-level digital twins that are analyzed and discussed in detail. As a conclusion, we propose that large system-level DT-projects have a managerial rationale only when several preliminary conditions are met and fulfilled.",

Consequently, Decisional DNA-based knowledge representation of manufacturing objects, processes, and system is achieved by virtual engineering objects (VEO), virtual engineering processes (VEP), and virtual engineering factories (VEF), respectively. In this study, assimilation of VEO-VEP-VEF concept in the Cyber-physical system-based Industry 4.0 is proposed. The planned concept is implemented on a case study. Also, Decisional DNA features such as similarity identification and phenotyping are explored for validation. It is concluded that this approach can support Industry 4.0 and can facilitate in real time critical, creative, and effective decision making.",

      "Abstract": "This study solved a practical problem in a case in the sheet metal industry using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The problem in the case company was related to detecting the minimum gaps between components, which were produced after the punching operation of a metal sheet. Due to the narrow gaps between the components, an automated sheer machine could not grip the rest of the sheet skeleton properly after the punching operation. This resulted in some of the scraped sheet on the worktable being left behind, which needed a human operator to intervene. This caused an extra trigger to the production line that resulted in a break in production. To solve this critical problem, the relevant images of the components and the gaps between them were analyzed using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The outcome of this study contributed to eliminating the production bottleneck by optimizing the gaps between the punched components. This optimization process facilitated the easy and safe movement of the gripper machine and contributed to minimizing the sheet waste.",

      "Abstract": "Additive manufacturing becomes a more and more important technology for production, mainly driven by the ability to realise extremely complex structures using multiple materials but without assembly or excessive waste. Nevertheless, like any high-precision technology additive manufacturing responds to interferences during the manufacturing process. These interferences–like vibrations–might lead to deviations in product quality, becoming manifest for instance in a reduced lifetime of a product or application issues. This study targets the issue of detecting such interferences during a manufacturing process in an exemplary experimental setup. Collection of data using current sensor technology directly on a 3D-printer enables a quantitative detection of interferences. The evaluation provides insights into the effectiveness of the realised application-oriented setup, the effort required for equipping a manufacturing system with sensors, and the effort for acquisition and processing the data. These insights are of practical utility for organisations dealing with additive manufacturing: the chosen approach for detecting interferences shows promising results, reaching interference detection rates of up to 100% depending on the applied data processing configuration.",

      "Title": "FPGA based Industrial Ethernet Network Analyser for Real-time Systems Providing Openness for Industry 4.0",
      "Abstract": "In modern cyber-physical systems, there is a high degree of connectivity that is imperative to satisfy the Four Industrial Revolution paradigm (Industry 4.0). While creating new systems according to the Industry 4.0, there are several protocols and solutions that can be applied. However, the introduction of Industry 4.0 to the existing industrial systems is not so straightforward. One point of consideration is the necessity of system modification, and another is the potential security threats a system could face. A solution presented in this paper addressing these issues is a FPGA-based network analyser with network datagram filtering and process data extraction. The analyser is transparent and may be applied without alterations to the monitored system. Moreover, there is no risk of influencing the system operation either by the data extraction device itself or by unauthorised access from the Internet, because the FPGA is a passive device operating as a data diode. The presented solution allows for the integration of existing Ethernet-based systems with cloud services for further processing of the data obtained from the monitored system. The FPGA makes process data available for the enterprise information systems.",

      "Abstract": "Industry 4.0 represents a new industrial paradigm ignited by disruptive technologies that can transform manufacturing into a cyber-physical system that integrates products, people and processes. However, there is little guidance concerning how to implement and integrate Industry 4.0 technologies by existing lean manufacturing (LM) systems. We select autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) and internet of things (IoT) to develop an action plan that helps managers integrate Industry 4.0 technologies into their manufacturing systems and achieve lean automation. We conducted a case study of a large manufacturing company that introduced AGVs and IoT to automate its lean operations. We used socio-technical systems (STSs) design logic to integrate the two distinct domains (lean and automation) into an action plan that successfully meets six lean automation objectives. The findings demonstrate that AGVs implementation should include three phases: design, integration and continuous improvement. The lean automation objectives are: cost, reusability, reliability, simplicity, compactness, fit, engage and culture. The lean automation plan successfully manages the interactions and interplay between social factors (people and culture), technical factors (infrastructure and technology) and operational factors (routines and processes). The lean automation plan has significant managerial implications helping companies integrate lean philosophy, which is people-centric, with Industry 4.0 technologies, which promote efficiency via automation.",

      "Abstract": "In the past 10 years, ubiquitous manufacturing (UM) has received a growing amount of attention among researchers in the manufacturing community because ubiquitous computing technologies (UCTs) can be applied to address a wide range of issues in the manufacturing industry, e.g. manufacturing processes and equipment, manufacturing management and planning. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is a lack of comprehensive and critical review from a holistic view of the state-of-the-art UM and its systems. This paper aims to provide a concise overview of the technical features, characteristics and broad range of applications of UM systems published between 1997 and 2017. Among these selected articles, more than 70% of them were published between 2012 and 2017, and they are considered as recent pertinent works which will be discussed in detail. The unique aspects of this paper lie in that this paper summarises and analyses a broad range of the state-of-the-art implementation of UM systems from a holistic and comprehensive view of manufacturing technology, including UM for manufacturing processes, manufacturing control systems, logistics, remanufacturing, cloud manufacturing, production scheduling, production quality control and evaluation, etc. In addition, the current limitation factors and future trends of UM development will also be discussed.",

      "Abstract": "The emergence of abnormal events (e.g. personnel abnormalities, equipment failures, etc.) on the assembly floor of complex products can seriously affect normal assembly progress. In response to the problems of poor timeliness and lack of predictability in the control of abnormal events on the assembly floor, a method for predicting abnormal events on the assembly floor of complex products based on digital twin technology is proposed. A model for predicting abnormal assembly events is constructed with the physical assembly workshop, virtual assembly workshop, assembly workshop twin data platform and abnormal events prediction service system working together, and its prediction operation mechanism is designed based on the classification of abnormal events and the workflow of the mechanism under different states is analysed. The Grey-Markov method is used to predict abnormal assembly events and provide real-time information for the planning and scheduling system. In order to verify the effectiveness of this scheme, combined with the electrical multiple units bogie assembly workshop, the prediction of the number of equipment failures at the bottleneck station is achieved. The prediction accuracy is much better than that of the GM(1,1) model and can be applied to actual production.",

      "Abstract": "Air cargo loading in terminals demands precise planning to ensure efficient operations and minimise costs with limited time in the airport. Real-time visualisation and loading optimisation are becoming increasingly important due to dynamic loading considerations, including the segregation of dangerous goods and inherent lithium batteries, weight balancing, and oversize cargo handling. A closed-loop dynamic air cargo loading digital twin system, integrating a cargo load plan optimisation simulation, multi-dimensional immersive virtual reality system, Internet of Things, and real-time sensors, is proposed for connecting, monitoring and controlling the operations in physical operations and virtual space. A Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE)-based virtual reality system is used to visualise and experiment with loading procedures. The system uses a feedback loop during sensor data capture to facilitates the decision-making processes on the optimal cargo load plan. Scenarios are discussed demonstrating the impact of the digital twin system on the daily operations of an air cargo terminal, especially the allocation of dangerous goods and special cargo. Load planners can master complex air cargo load planning through the system with optimal solutions generated. The operations of cargo assembly and security screening with digital twins could be further developed for future development.",

      "Abstract": "The modern manufacturing industry is investing in new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, cloud computing and cybersecurity to cope with system complexity, increase information visibility, improve production performance, and gain competitive advantages in the global market. These advances are rapidly enabling a new generation of smart manufacturing, i.e., a cyber-physical system tightly integrating manufacturing enterprises in the physical world with virtual enterprises in cyberspace. To a great extent, realizing the full potential of cyber-physical systems depends on the development of new methodologies on the Internet of Manufacturing Things (IoMT) for data-enabled engineering innovations. This article presents a review of the IoT technologies and systems that are the drivers and foundations of data-driven innovations in smart manufacturing. We discuss the evolution of internet from computer networks to human networks to the latest era of smart and connected networks of manufacturing things (e.g., materials, sensors, equipment, people, products, and supply chain). In addition, we present a new framework that leverages IoMT and cloud computing to develop a virtual machine network. We further extend our review to IoMT cybersecurity issues that are of paramount importance to businesses and operations, as well as IoT and smart manufacturing policies that are laid out by governments around the world for the future of smart factory. Finally, we present the challenges and opportunities arising from IoMT. We hope this work will help catalyze more in-depth investigations and multi-disciplinary research efforts to advance IoMT technologies.",

Industry 4.0 is the boost for smart manufacturing and demands flexibility and adaptability of all devices/machines in the shop floor. The machines must become smart and interact with other machines inside and outside the industries/factories. The predictive maintenance is a key topic in this industrial revolution. The reason is based on the idea that smart machines must be capable to automatically identify and predict possible faults and actuate before they occur. Vibrations can be problematic in electrical motors. For this reason, we address an experimental study associated with an automatic classification procedure, that runs in the smart devices to detect anomalies. The results corroborate the applicability and usefulness of this machine learning algorithm to predict vibration faults.",

      "Abstract": "Rapid advances in new generation information technologies, such as big data analytics, internet of things (IoT), edge computing and artificial intelligence, have nowadays driven traditional manufacturing all the way to intelligent manufacturing. Intelligent manufacturing is characterised by autonomy and self-optimisation, which proposes new demands such as learning and cognitive capacities for manufacturing cell, known as the minimum implementation unit for intelligent manufacturing. Consequently, this paper proposes a general framework for knowledge-driven digital twin manufacturing cell (KDTMC) towards intelligent manufacturing, which could support autonomous manufacturing by an intelligent perceiving, simulating, understanding, predicting, optimising and controlling strategy. Three key enabling technologies including digital twin model, dynamic knowledge bases and knowledge-based intelligent skills for supporting the above strategy are analysed, which equip KDTMC with the capacities of self-thinking, self-decision-making, self-execution and self-improving. The implementing methods of KDTMC are also introduced by a thus constructed test bed. Three application examples about intelligent process planning, intelligent production scheduling and production process analysis and dynamic regulation demonstrate the feasibility of KDTMC, which provides a practical insight into the intelligent manufacturing paradigm.",

      "Abstract": "This chapter discusses some studies focusing on the cyber‐physical system (CPS) modeling, stability analysis and reliability improvement, and the gains and deadtime of transfer function of CPSs. In the CPS, uncertainties can be associated with the variation in the deadtime L caused by aging process or by transmission delays and to the simplifications used in approximating the dead‐time‐free dynamics of the control process by a transfer function. The impact of uncertainties analysis can be made for the general case but the chapter focuses on the case where the nominal models are the simple first‐order‐plus‐dead‐time transfer function, since it is the most widely used in industrial applications. The delay margin of the CPS can be defined as the largest ' variation in the deadtime that is allowed to occur in the process P before the closed‐loop'.",

      "Abstract": "Many aircraft assets are subject to both preventive (scheduled) and corrective (unscheduled) replacement policies to ensure adequate levels of reliability and availability. The problem, particularly for assets that exist in large quantities, is that preventive replacement tasks often involve removing the entire population of assets from the aircraft, regardless of whether any assets were previously replaced on a corrective basis beforehand. To avoid the costs associated with premature asset removal, this study assesses the use of a cyber-physical systems approach to the management of identified aircraft assets. This approach builds on an industrial architecture that has been implemented and deployed in the aviation maintenance environment. This study outlines how the cyber-physical based identification of assets can facilitate balancing maintenance replacement policies to optimise long-run average costs per unit time. A mathematical model is proposed, and the suggested approach is validated using industrial data.",

      "Title": "Operationalizing digital twins through model-based systems engineering methods",
      "Abstract": "In recent years there has been increased demand for readiness and availability metrics across many industries and especially in national defense to enable data-driven decision making at all levels of planning, maintenance, and operations, and in leveraging integrated models that inform stakeholders of current operational system health and performance metrics. The digital twin (DT) has been identified as a promising approach for deploying these models to fielded systems although several challenges exist in wide adoption and implementation. Two challenges examined in this article are that the nature of DT development is a system-specific endeavor, and the development is usually an additional effort that begins after initial system fielding. A fundamental challenge with DT development, which sets it apart from traditional models, is the DT itself is treated as a separate system, and therefore the physical asset/DT construct becomes a system-of-systems problem. This article explores how objectives in DT development align with those of model-based systems engineering (MBSE), and how the MBSE process can answer questions necessary to define the DT. The key benefits to the approach are leveraging work already being performed during system synthesis and DT development is pushed earlier in a system's lifecycle. This article contributes to the definition and development processes for DTs by proposing a DT development model and path, a method for scoping and defining requirements for a DT, and an approach to integrate DT and system development. An example case study of a Naval unmanned system is presented to illustrate the contributions.",

The demand for increased lifetime and higher reliability has attracted a significant number of research studies on the prognostics and lifetime estimation of LEDs, ranging from the traditional failure data analysis to the latest degradation modeling and machine learning based approaches over the past couple of years. However, there is a lack of reviews that systematically address the currently evolving machine learning algorithms and methods for fault detection, diagnostics, and lifetime prediction of LEDs. To address those deficiencies, a review on the diagnostic and prognostic methods and algorithms based on machine learning that helps to improve system performance, reliability, and lifetime assessment of LEDs is provided. The fundamental principles, pros and cons of methods including artificial neural networks, principal component analysis, hidden Markov models, support vector machines, and Bayesian networks are presented. Finally, discussion on the prospects of the machine learning implementation from LED packages, components to system level reliability analysis, potential challenges and opportunities, and the future digital twin technology for LEDs lifetime analysis is provided.",

      "Abstract": "The move towards advanced manufacturing and Industry 4.0 is fed by increased demand for speeding up innovation, increasing flexibility, improving maintenance, and becoming more customized while saving on the total cost of operations. This is accompanied by increased dependence on virtual product and process development, data-driven processes, and product knowledge. Other characteristics, affecting modern design, include big data intelligence in product, process, and maintenance. New technologies that empower data analytics include added manufacturing, flexible manufacturing, robotics, sensor technology, smart value/supply chains, and industrial information backbones. This paper is about surrogate models, also called digital twins, that provide an important complementary capacity to physical assets. Digital twins capture past, present, and predicted behavior of physical assets. Digital twin models are updated periodically to represent the current state of physical assets. This distinguishes digital twins from conventional simulations in that sensor data can continuously feed them. The type of curated information on the state of physical asset's history depends on how digital twins are used. For example, if a digital twin is used for fault classification, the history captured is operational data from equipment in healthy and faulty states. We provide here a review of digital twins, with an emphasis on Industry 4.0 applications.",

Safety standards emphasize the use of formal analysis in CPS development processes. Performance degradation assessment and estimation of lifetime of energy storage (electric batteries) are vital in supporting maintenance decisions and guaranteeing CPS reliability. Existing formal analysis techniques mainly focus on specifying energy constraints in simplified manners and checking whether systems operate within given energy bounds. Leading to overlooked energy features that impede development of trustworthy CPS. Prognostics and health management (PHM) estimate energy uncertainty and predict remaining life of systems. We aim to utilize PHM techniques to rigorously model dynamic energy behaviors; resulting models are amenable to formal analysis. This project will increase the degree of maintenance of CPS while (non)-functional requirements are preserved correctly.",

      "Abstract": "Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are vital energy-storage devices in modern society. However, the performance and cost are still not satisfactory in terms of energy density, power density, cycle life, safety, etc. To further improve the performance of batteries, traditional “trial-and-error” processes require a vast number of tedious experiments. Computational chemistry and artificial intelligence (AI) can significantly accelerate the research and development of novel battery systems. Herein, a heterogeneous category of AI technology for predicting and discovering battery materials and estimating the state of the battery system is reviewed. Successful examples, the challenges of deploying AI in real-world scenarios, and an integrated framework are analyzed and outlined. The state-of-the-art research about the applications of ML in the property prediction and battery discovery, including electrolyte and electrode materials, are further summarized. Meanwhile, the prediction of battery states is also provided. Finally, various existing challenges and the framework to tackle the challenges on the further development of machine learning for rechargeable LIBs are proposed.",

      "Abstract": "This chapter addresses the status of artificial intelligence (AI) as a central element in smart grid (SG) while focusing on the recent progress of research on machine learning techniques to pave the future work in the SG area. The SG framework provides a performance toolkit based on information and communication technologies. The SG paradigm supervises and promotes grid operations at a high level of expertise. AI systems have attributed to the realization of sustainable development goals including the vital integration of renewable energy sources (RES). The scarcity of conventional energy resources in the near future and their increasing threats to the environment extremely require the transition toward RES. The bulk penetration of RES into the electrical grid leads to unstable and volatile power generation.

      "Abstract": "This article uses case studies to demonstrate the potential of smart manufacturing (SM) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to enhance operational performance and productivity in industry. The analysis highlights benefits such as cost reduction, production flexibility, shorter product time-to-market, energy/water efficiency and environmental impact reduction, and increased productivity. To illustrate the effectiveness of SM and IoT approaches, the authors sought out manufacturers currently implementing or seeking to implement SM and IoT technologies. The authors identified beer brewing (NAICS Code 312120) as a rapidly expanding industry whose members appear eager to implement SM technologies to optimize production lines by revealing bottlenecks and identifying performance-reducing nodes. This article presents two case studies based on SM and IoT technologies in breweries. It briefly describes a systematic framework introduced elsewhere by the authors and uses it to assess the energy productivity and competitiveness of SM applications in breweries. This article addresses questions concerning the information and communications technology infrastructure needed to build smart breweries and how corporations simplify the installation and deployment of SM and IoT components.

      "Abstract": "The increasing popularity of the electric vehicles (EVs) is due to various environmental impacts of the gasoline-/diesel-based vehicles over the past few decades. EVs are commercialized in various parts of world but their full-scale commercialization has not yet attained. Despite of many advantages, challenges associated with the use of EVs are their range anxiety, slow charging, and the performance/cost of battery. A thorough review from the year 2006 to 2020 is conducted in the field of battery management system (BMS). Herein, various functions, advantages, and disadvantages of methods used in BMS for cell balancing, thermal management, and protection of battery against over-voltage and over current, estimation of state of health, and estimation of state of charge of battery are discussed. Additionally, critical gaps are identified and a framework for design of an efficient BMS is proposed. The deployment of advanced intelligent and smart technologies such as digital-twin of battery pack, cyber-physical systems, battery swapping technology, nondestructive testing, self-reconfigurable batteries, and prudent recycling/reusability using automation are also discussed.

      "Title": "Industrial wireless sensor and actuator networks in industry 4.0: Exploring requirements, protocols, and challenges—A MAC survey",
      "Abstract": "The vision to connect everyday physical objects to the Internet promises to create the Internet of Things (IoT), which is expected to integrate the diverse technologies such as sensors, actuators, radio frequency identification, communication technologies, and Internet protocols. Thus, IoT promises to transfer traditional industry to advance digital industry known as the Industry 4.0. At the core of the Industry 4.0 are the wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs) that led to the development of industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) and industrial wireless sensor and actuator networks (IWSANs). These networks play a central role of connecting machines, parts, products, and humans and create a diverse set of new applications to support intelligent and autonomous decision making. The IWSAN is a promising technology for numerous industrial applications because of their several potential benefits such as simple deployment, low cost, less complexity, and mobility support. However, despite such benefits, they impose several unique challenges at different layers of the protocol stack when deploying them for various monitoring and control applications in the Industry 4.0. In this article, we explore IWSAN, its applications, requirements, challenges, and solutions in the context of industrial control applications. Our main focus is on the medium access control (MAC) layer that can be exploited to satisfy such requirements. Our discussion presents extensive background study of the MAC schemes and it reviews the MAC protocols of the existing wireless standards and technologies. A number of application-specific MAC protocols developed to support industrial applications, which are not part of these standards, are also elaborated. We rationalize to what extent the existing standards and protocols help in solving such requirements as laid down by the Industry 4.0. In the end, we emphasize on existing challenges and present important future directions.",

      "Title": "Efficient identification of random fields coupling Bayesian inference and PGD reduced order model for damage localization",
      "Abstract": "One of the main challenges regarding our civil infrastructure is the efficient operation over their complete design lifetime while complying with standards and safety regulations. Thus, costs for maintenance or replacements must be optimized while still ensuring specified safety levels. This requires an accurate estimate of the current state as well as a prognosis for the remaining useful life. Currently, this is often done by regular manual or visual inspections within constant intervals. However, the critical sections are often not directly accessible or impossible to be instrumented at all. Model-based approaches can be used where a digital twin of the structure is set up. For these approaches, a key challenge is the calibration and validation of the numerical model based on uncertain measurement data. The aim of this contribution is to increase the efficiency of model updating by using the advantage of model reduction (Proper Generalized Decomposition, PGD) and applying the derived method for efficient model identification of a random stiffness field of a real bridge.",

      "Abstract": "Online fault detection, isolation and recovery using smart sensors play an important role in intelligent manufacturing system. Fibre optic sensors are very interesting for condition monitoring applications due to the advantage of this technology. Here, the experimental demonstration of Cu-based shape memory alloy (SMA) coated optical fibre for temperature-based sensing applications is reported. The benefit of Cu-based SMA coated optical fibre over conventional metallic coating has been evaluated in the study. For consistent coating, an in situ fixture with a rotary drive setup has been designed and developed. Thermo optic test bench has been developed to study the actuation characteristics of the SMA coated optical fibre for varying current and voltage. Experiments were performed to investigate the light intensity in the SMA coated optical fibre at different actuation conditions. The displacement that takes place in the optical fibre due to the external temperature stimuli will create proportional intensity and wavelength shifts. The maximum average displacement of 4.9 mm has been achieved for Cu-Al-Mn-Ni coated optical fibre. Results show variation in the optical fibre signal due to heating and cooling of the fibre from the applied electrical stimulus on Cu-based SMA coating in the form of austenite to martensite transformation.",

The parameters of the structure were estimated to illustrate the stochastic relationship between the degradation process and the monitoring indicator by using unsupervised learning methods. Random vibration tests on solder joints with different levels of power spectral density and fixed forms were conducted with a real time monitoring electrical resistance to examine the suitability of the model. It was experimentally verified that the multistate degradation structure matches the experimental process reasonably and accurately. Based on this multistate degradation model, the online prognostics of solder joint were analyzed and the results indicated that faults or failures can be detected timely, leading to appreciate maintenance actions scheduled to avoid catastrophic failures of electronics.",

First, the MPdist similarity comparison algorithm is used to construct the mechanical axis health index. Then the hidden Markov model is trained with observable sensor data. After that, the temporal convolution neural network is used to predict state transition time iteratively, and the predicted results are decoded by HMM. The experimental results show that the HMM-TCN model can accurately assess the health state of the mechanical axis and predict the state transition in real-time. The prediction accuracy of this method reaches 87.5%, and the error interval locates in [−3,9] time steps. The accuracy, early/late prediction indicators are better than HMM-RNN, HMM-LSTM, and HMM-GRU.",

Firewall and air-gapped systems are widely used to harden cybersecurity defence of critical power system infrastructure. However, cyber-attack, such as global positioning system (GPS) spoofing, that can compromise the air-gap system has not been investigated thoroughly. As a geographically dispersed cyber-physical system, the power system relies heavily on the GPS to keep time synchronisation of different parts with high precision. GPS spoofing-based time synchronisation attack (TSA) could induce disorder in time synchronisation, and negatively impact or even disable monitoring and control function of the power system via their operation mechanism. The principles of GPS-based time synchronisation and GPS spoofing-based TSA are introduced. Time synchronisation and operation mechanism of typical monitoring and control systems of the power systems are analysed. Thereafter, the consequences of TSA against these systems are analysed. Various techniques that can be used to defend against TSA are depicted and their performances are analysed.",

      "Title": "An AI Driven Real-time 3-D Representation of an Off-shore WT for Fault Diagnosis and Monitoring",
      "Abstract": "In recent years, digital twin (DT) has been an efficient and reliable representation tool for Industry 4.0 in general and fault diagnosis and monitoring, especially in machinery consisting of several components working in tandem that introduce a large amount of data to be processed. Having a cloud-based and platformindependent system that can interpret Big Data in real-time and represent the processed information in a user-friendly manner offers the opportunity not only for improving fault diagnosis and troubleshooting automation, but also offering a better representation of data for operators, technicians and engineers. This not only decreases the repair costs by enabling constant components' state of health awareness, but also increases the efficacy of the apparatus by lowering the downtimes due to faults and issues. In this paper (WindTwin), we propose a real-time, interactive and dynamic 3-D neural-network model that provides important information of a small-scale wind turbine (WT) machinery setup including the state of health of different components (bearings, shafts) based on monitoring sensors (vibrations and temperature) and operations conditions (rotation speed). The system features real-time data processing of six sensors with eight channels including two single axis-accelerometer, one tri-axial accelerometer, one acoustics (microphone), one temperature and one light sensor (for rotational speed) with sampling data collection rate of 51.2 kHz achieved through an edge developed machine learning algorithm based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm using single hidden-layer feed forward neural network (SLFN) and gradient-based backpropagation (BP) training algorithm. The system also provides platformindependent (desktop and mobile companion app) user interfaces thanks to its cloud-based data processing integration. The prototype system proved to have on average 83.33 % accuracy for the vibration-based condition monitoring model across the three different rotation speed of 15Hz, 9Hz and 12Hz with 1 second latency for different fault conditions to be reflected on the DT counterpart.",

      "Abstract": "Industry 4.0 aims at evolving the current industrial processes towards directly connecting shopfloor machines to systems from different layers of the automation pyramid, such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) or Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES). There are key functional and quality requirements that apply to most Industry 4.0 systems independent of the application domain, e.g., requirements related to interoperability, recoverability, security, and modifiability. Despite their importance, there is still a lack of understanding of (i) architecture drivers that focus on these quality aspects and (ii) architecture solutions for these architecture drivers that are adequate for a wide range of Industry 4.0 contexts. To contribute to filling this gap, we present in this paper (i) quality-centered architecture drivers derived from industrial cases, and (ii) architecture solutions based on the concepts of Digital Twins, Service-Oriented Architecture, and Virtual Automation Bus for four recurrent production plant scenarios. The architecture drivers and solutions presented in this paper were instantiated in different Industry 4.0 contexts, such as BaSys 4.0 (the German national reference project for Industry 4.0), and by the BaSys industry project partners.",

      "Abstract": "In the paper we want to share our experiences in developing a new telemaintenance system for industrial robots in an active production environment. This has been achieved within a three-year research project. In this article we describe the design methods we have used, and our evaluation approaches. The challenge of developing user interfaces for those prototypes lies in the special requirements of the industrial work domain. Highly sophisticated technical tasks need to be carried out under time pressure and in a noisy environment. The human machine interaction of the remote tasks is especially difficult. There's no experience with those remote tasks, as they are only possible with the developed technology. The scope of the paper lies in the design process, not in the evaluation results, which will be published separately.",

      "Abstract": "Industry 4.0 involves enhancing industrial processes with high-fidelity and high-value information from machines, workers, and products. Industry 4.0 applications improve production efficiency, product quality, etc., by using Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Existing industry 4.0 application development approaches are centered on commercial IoT platforms that provide siloed development and runtime environments (leading to vendor lockdown) and only support individual sensors and actuators instead of entire machines. Therefore, Industry 4.0 applications need to construct representations of complex machines from such basic elements, which is a costly, error-prone, inefficient hindering portability across machines and plants. This paper proposes Cyber Twins, a comprehensive solution for efficient Industry 4.0 application development, testing, and portability. The Cyber Twins solution includes a model for machine representation and services that facilitate Industry 4.0 application development. Finally, a prototype Cyber Twin implementation is presented, with its functionality described using a sample Industry 4.0 application.",

      "Abstract": "Driven by the core technologies, i.e., sensor-based autonomous data acquisition and the cloud-based big data analysis, IoT automates the actuation of data-driven intelligent actions on the connected objects. This automation enables numerous useful real-life use-cases, such as smart transport, smart living, smart cities, and so on. However, recent industry surveys reflect that data-related challenges are responsible for slower growth of IoT in recent years. For this reason, this article presents a systematic and comprehensive survey on IoT Big Data (IoTBD) with the aim to identify the uncharted challenges for IoTBD. This article analyzes the state-of-the-art academic works in IoT and big data management across various domains and proposes a taxonomy for IoTBD management. Then, the survey explores the IoT portfolio of major cloud vendors and provides a classification of vendor services for the integration of IoT and IoTBD on their cloud platforms. After that, the survey identifies the IoTBD challenges in terms of 13 V's challenges and envisions IoTBD as \"Big Data 2.0.\"Then the survey provides comprehensive analysis of recent works that address IoTBD challenges by highlighting their strengths and weaknesses to assess the recent trends and future research directions. Finally, the survey concludes with discussion on open research issues for IoTBD.",

Therefore, fishery farmers have started adopting smart fisheries technologies to better manage their fish farms. Despite their technological advancements smart fisheries are exposed and vulnerable to cyber-attacks that would cause a negative impact on the ecosystem both physically and economically. Therefore in this paper, we present a smart fisheries ecosystem where the architecture describes various interactions that happen between internet connected devices. We develop a smart fisheries ontology based on the architecture and implement Attribute Based Access Control System (ABAC) where access to resources of smart fisheries is granted by evaluating the requests. We also discuss how access control decisions are made in multiple use case scenarios of a smart fisheries ecosystem. Furthermore, we elaborate on some AI applications that would enhance the smart fisheries ecosystem.",

      "Abstract": "An intelligent combination of the Internet of Things (IoT) and approaches to modeling and simulation is one of the most challenging endeavors for future cities, manufacturing industries, and predictive maintenance. Digital Twins take on a unique role here. However, the question of what a Digital Twin is and what differentiates it from a regular model is still open. We present an experimental setup for integrating an existing simulation model of Hamburg's traffic system with the city's real-time sensor network. The Digital Twin is implemented using the large-scale multi-agent framework MARS. The entire process from the model description to retrieving real-time data from the IoT sensors and incorporating it in the simulation is presented. As a first prototypical example, a multi-modal mobility model was connected to real-world bike-sharing locations in Hamburg. We find that the combination of multi-agent systems and IoT sensors as a Digital Twin shows enormous potential for city planners, policy stakeholders, and other decision-makers. By correcting the course of a simulation via real-time data, the corridor-of-uncertainty that is intrinsic to some simulation models' use can be reduced significantly. Furthermore, any divergence of simulated and sampled data can lead to a deeper understanding of complex adaptive systems like big cities.",

      "Title": "Integrating digital twin security simulations in the security operations center",
      "Abstract": "While industrial environments are increasingly equipped with sensors and integrated to enterprise networks, current security strategies are generally not prepared for the growing attack surface that resides from the convergence of their IT infrastructure with the industrial systems. As a result, the organizations responsible for corporate security, the Security Operations Center (SOC), are overwhelmed with the integration of the industrial systems. To facilitate monitoring the industrial assets, digital twins represent a helpful novel concept. They are the virtual counterparts of such assets and provide valuable insights through collecting asset-centric data, analytic capabilities and simulations. Moreover, digital twins can assist enterprise security by simulating attacks and analyzing the effect on the virtual counterpart. However, the integration of digital twin security simulations into enterprise security strategies, that are mainly controlled by the SOC, is currently neglected. To close this research gap, this work develops a process-based security framework to incorporate digital twin security simulations in the SOC. In the course of this work, a use case along with a digital twin-based security simulation provides proof of concept. It is demonstrated how a man-in-the-middle attack can be performed in a simulated industry setting and how it affects the systems. Moreover, we show how the resulting system logs can support the SOC by building technical rules to implement in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.",

However, it is still unclear how live data transmitted by connected devices informs the design of these products, going beyond performance optimisation to support creative practices. Design can be enriched by data captured by connected devices, from usage logs to environmental sensors, and data about the devices and people around them. Through a series of workshops, this paper contributes industry and academia perspectives on the future of data-driven product design. We highlight HCI challenges, issues and implications, including sensemaking and the generation of design insight. We further challenge current notions of data-driven design and envision ways in which future HCI research can develop ways to work with data in the design process in a connected, rich, human manner.",

This study tries to find out the key success factors of Industry 4.0 from the cases of European manufacturing enterprises. The development histories of Siemens, Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) and Schneider electrics were analyzed through multiple cases comparisons. The same and different factors were compared to find out the key success factors of industry 4.0 development through thematic analysis. The key success factors of industry 4.0 identified is helpful for guiding the development strategy and transformation plan for other companies in the future.",

The IIoT forms the backbone for materializing the Industry 4.0 initiative. Actionable insights obtained from industrial analytics are one of the pivotal means for achieving intelligent operations and maintenance. Intelligence refers to making optimal decisions for both automated and human-in-the-loop decision making. Condition-based predictive maintenance (CBPdM), also known as Maintenance 4.0, is among the major focus points of the Industry 4.0 and IIoT. In this paper, we discuss the existing standards related to condition-based maintenance and the potential of the Open Industrial Interoperability Ecosystem (OIIE), a MIMOSA led initiative, as a framework which extends previous open standards for achieving CBPdM. We illustrate how the framework addresses the requirements of Industry 4.0 and CBPdM.",

      "Abstract": "Many concepts of process management are being intensively discussed in current research. The background is often that within the megatrend of digitization, workflows are automated. Furthermore, processes are fundamentally reconsidered in the digital transformation of organizations. What contribution S-BPM can make in the future of digital process management is analyzed in this paper aiming at the anniversary conference of S-BPM. As basis for the analysis serves the idea that, the suitability of BPM concepts (such as S-BPM) for certain application domains depends on essential process properties. Based on an assessment model we analyze under what conditions subject orientation can be well used (e.g., focus on collaboration). Using these results, we are evaluating the opportunities of S-BPM for the digital future. The evaluation is based on the three exemplary trends (i) digital development/products, (ii) digital production and (iii) digital business transformation. In these trend, we asses which conditions change (e.g. fast changing environments, machine-To-machine-communication, user-centered thinking) and to what degree S-BPM can still contribute in the new digital world. In a nutshell, our findings reveal that subject orientation is well suited for collaborative processes involving many different human and non-human stakeholders, but has deficiencies when dealing with autonomous and unstructured systems, both upcoming trends in the digital transformation.",

      "Abstract": "In recent years, several countries have created policies to enforce Zero Energy Building (ZEB) standards for new building construction. Achieving this for new buildings is feasible, but it may be difficult to transform existing buildings to ZEBs. Digital twins provide a promising approach to monitor existing buildings and further increase their energy efficiency. A digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a physical entity. It has several applications in product design, product cycle, and fault detection. This paper presents a hybrid approach that combines physics-based and machine learning methods to create a DT for the built environment. A case study for a digital twin of a single room is also discussed. The initial comparison of cooling energy between the physical testbed and the DT model shows promising results for future development. The limitations, challenges, and future development of the approach are also addressed in the paper.",

      "Title": "Utilizing building information models as operating systems for smart homes",
      "Abstract": "The prevalence of IoT enabled devices in the home has manifested in buildings as voice and gesture enabled devices that enable functions such as optimizing energy usage and controlling electrical fixtures. However, most of these are fundamentally dissociated from the spatial nature of buildings as they exist in isolation from the building system and other smart devices in the same space. This situation results in user interaction experiences that are convoluted and non-intuitive, negatively affecting their adoption. Meanwhile, Building Information Models, while used extensively in a building’s design and construction phases, remains underutilized in its operation phase. This paper proposes BIM as an “operating system” for smart homes to serve as the foundational platform for smart device applications. Much like the analogous operating system for computers, BIM serves to provide IoT enabled devices access to information and control over various components of the built environment. It is expected that this smart home architecture would enable seamless integration of smart home functionality across devices and buildings to provide residents with contextualized information for optimized security, comfort, and efficiency. Methods for personalizing building performance to users can also be accomplished through the proposed methodology.",

      "Title": "<i>Drive by maintenance</i>: towards adaptive work environments with improved industrial HCI",
      "Abstract": "Although automation is the backbone of the modern industrial complex, humans remain the indispensable shepherds of the machine park. One operator may be responsible for several machines that need to run continuously. Unfortunately, the complexity of the machines and processes increased faster than the improvement in the corresponding interaction technologies. We propose a multi-modal adaptive human computer interface system for the modern industry that relies on position, activity and other relevant contextual information, in order to provide a more flexible interaction in industrial scenarios. Information about the machine, is transmitted to the worker using a vibrotactile display on his wrist whenever the line of sight is broken. The context in which the user and the machine currently reside in, are determined by software artefacts (Apps). We leverage modern software concepts and an App based eco-system platform on the manufacturing shop floor to organize the software systems described in this paper. We evaluate transmitting arbitrary information via vibrotactile displays and come to the conclusion that such a system is feasible in industrial settings and may be beneficial as it has a very low distraction rate.",

      "Abstract": "In this work, we develop a vision for entangled ethnography, where constellations of people, artefacts, algorithms and data come together to collectively make sense of the relations between people and objects. This is grounded in New Materialism’s picture of a world understood through entanglement, through resonant constellations, through a multiplicity of unique individual viewpoints and their relationships. These perspectives are especially relevant for design ethnography, in particular for research around smart connected products, which collect data about their environment, the networks they are a part of, and the ways they are used. However, we are concerned about the current trend of many connected systems towards surveillance capitalism, as data is colonised, machinations are hidden, and a narrow definition of value is extracted. There is a key tension that while design, particularly of networked objects, attempts to go beyond human centeredness, the infrastructures that support it are moving towards a less than human perspective in their race to accumulate and dispossess. Our work tries to imagine the situations where participants in networked systems are richly engaged, rather than exploited. We hope for a future where human agency is central to a respectful and acceptable collaborative development of understanding.",

It starts with the historic evolution of industry, separated by date landmarks and approaches the last transition between 3.0 to 4.0. Apart from the differences between industry models, production data stats show a huge and important transformation in the amount of data related to manufacturing and how that knowledge is processed. The paper also aims to put on debate the lack of solutions regarding the knowledge extraction of data from machines and systems, needed for data analytics. Approaches with cyber-physical systems, machine learning, virtual environments, Industrial IoT 1 and augmented reality, in an industrial scale, are some of the strategies to power the reading and interpretation of data, in order to promote industrial efficiency. Real context industrial applications are taken into account in order to state the importance of collected data in the efficiency of a production process. Exploring technologies and concepts to improve digital twins systems, perception and perceived systems as well as maintenance processes are some of the explored implemented strategies that make Industry 4.0. Some possible strategies are presented, as well as the transition for Industry 5.0.",

Issues include demand for customized products, changes in orders, and equipment status change, complicating the decision-making process. A real-time digital representation of the manufacturing operation would help address these challenges. Recent technology advancements of smart sensors, IoT, and cloud computing make it possible to realize a “digital twin” of a manufacturing system or process. Digital twins or surrogates are data-driven virtual representations that replicate, connect, and synchronize the operation of a manufacturing system or process. They utilize dynamically collected data to track system behaviors, analyze performance, and help make decisions without interrupting production. In this paper, we define digital surrogate, explore their relationships to simulation, digital thread, artificial intelligence, and IoT. We identify the technology and standard requirements and challenges for implementing digital surrogates. A production planning case is used to exemplify the digital surrogate concept.",

      "Abstract": "Automated monitoring of deployed Cyber-physical Systems during operation can assist in detecting misbehavior. One way to achieve such monitoring is via co-simulation of a modelled system corresponding to the deployed system. Our work addresses the topic of brokering external data into an Functional Mock-up Interface 2.0 enabled co-simulation via a Functional Mock-up Unit (a simulation unit) called RabbitMQ FMU and an external message queue. Our contribution includes a formal specification that captures the semantics of RabbitMQ FMU and ensures a maximum delay on the messages relayed to the co-simulation even through an unreliable network. This formal specification is used to generate test cases that exercise all states and transitions. The implementation is subjected to these test cases to verify that it is a refinement of the specification. The verification is ongoing and the implementation has successfully been subjected to 1,539,246 tests.",

Machine tool should be digital and intelligent, providing some manufacturing service via the Internet of Things. In order to solve the dynamic machine tool selection (DMTS), this paper proposes a novel decision-making approach based on real-time multi-agent. Firstly, the machine tool digital twin (MTDT) is introduced to provide real-time device data for evaluating machine tools. Based on MTDT, a real-time multi-agent-based mechanism (RTMAM) is designed for solving DMTS. Then based on exponential scale, the Analytic Hierarchy Process is modified for calculating the weight of evaluation index. The evaluation model of machine tool is solved by Reference Ideal Method (RIM). Finally, the proposed decision-making approach for DMTS is tested in an aviation plant.",

      "Abstract": "Changes in operating conditions, environment, and deterioration of structural health of components over time leads to unplanned outages in industrial equipment. A multicomponent industrial system may fail when one or more of its components deteriorate beyond a certain limit. The deterioration is often a gradual and continuous process, culminating in sudden failure of an equipment. However, the components in a system may show some early signs of deterioration that might not be explicitly apparent even to domain experts. Therefore, advanced algorithms are required for early detection of these signatures of failure to enable corrective actions in time. A set of algorithms is presented here to detect signatures of failure from the continuous sensor data in a multicomponent system. Each system consists of four identical components, each with a different timing of failure. A set of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based algorithms are employed to identify the onset of abnormal behavior. An ensemble framework, which minimizes the frequency of false and missed alarms is proposed and its performance is compared with other stand-alone algorithms. An ensemble approach on top of a set of LSTM-based models performed better than the individual algorithms.",

This paper takes a novel approach by extracting the fundamental knowledge of a data set from a production process and mapping it to an expert fuzzy rule set. Afterwards, new fundamental augmented data is generated by exploring the feature space of the previously generated fuzzy rule set. At the same time, a high number of artificial neural network (ANN) models with different hyperparameter configurations are created. The best models are chosen, in line with the idea of survival of the fittest, and improved with the additional training data sets, generated by the fuzzy rule simulation. It is shown that ANN models can be improved by adding fundamental knowledge represented by the discovered fuzzy rules. Those models can represent digitized machines as digital twins. The architecture and effectiveness of the digital twin is evaluated within an industry 4.0 use case.",

Since lithium-ion batteries are perishable goods and are subject to, for instance, aging effects, environmental and operating conditions during manufacturing and car usage need close supervision. With regard to the paradigm of digital twins, data from various life cycle phases can be collected and analyzed to deliver services. To fill the gap in literature, this paper describes a mixed methods-based stakeholder analysis of digital twins for battery systems resulting in a formalized, relational data set. We identify stakeholders in six life cycle stages and cluster them according to their interest and activity to form groups. Further on, relationships between interests and actions are examined to provide a deeper understanding of the complexity of interests and the underlying technical parameters. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and battery system manufacturer followed by car users are identified as the most critical stakeholders with the most interest in, and ability to take action towards, a digital battery twin. Further on, due to the cross-linked nature of battery systems and its digital services, many more specialized stakeholders occur.",

Our framework can support the synchronization of 1000 different sensors and actuators. The results of our Digital Twin are demonstrated using embedded, front-end sensing for offshore energy assets. It can filter and translate complex data and messages from any embedded sensor and operating system.

      "Abstract": "Considerable studies have been carried out in recent years regarding fault diagnosis and prediction for the rotating machinery in industrial plants. However, few works present the use of clustering approaches applied to time series to diagnose machine faults. With the increasing practical requirement of safety, reliability, availability and maintainability of machinery running, predictive maintenance based on the technologies of fault diagnosis and prediction has also received significant attention in recent years. In the present study, under Cyber-physical systems (CPS) condition, k-means clustering analysis based on the fault case big data machine learning is applied to investigate the fault identification of the rotating machinery without external expert support. K-means cluster-based fault identification model, which includes the k-means cluster analysis module, fault mode -fault cluster centroid knowledge base module and fault identification module has been constructed. Moreover, the fault feature extraction and fault eigenvectors screening are studied in detail. The vibration data of surge, rubbing, misalignment and normal status of the centrifugal compressor in industrial plants are utilized to train and verify the effectiveness of the kmeans cluster fault recognition model. The obtained result shows that recognition accuracy rates of the surge, rubbing and misalignment faults reach 94%, 100% and 80%, respectively. However, the effectiveness of the cluster analysis of vibration data for five or more operating states should be studied in the future.",

Since machinery faults are always caused by performance deterioration of components, learning the deteriorating mode from observed sensor data facilitates the prognostics of impeding faults and predicting the remaining useful life (RUL). In modern CPSs, several key performance indicators (KPIs) are monitored to detect the corresponding fine-grained deteriorating modes of industrial machines. However, the overall deterioration estimation and RUL prediction based on these KPIs with various patterns have been a great challenge, especially without labels of deteriorating index or uninterpretable of root causes. In this paper, we proposed K-PdM, a cluster-based hidden Markov model for the machinery deterioration estimation and RUL prediction based on multiple KPIs. The method uncovers the fine-grained deteriorating modes of machines through each unlabeled KPI data and learns a mapping between each deteriorating KPI index and RULs. Accordingly, an overall deterioration estimation and RUL prediction of machine are able to be achieved based on the combination of each KPI's deterioration estimation. Moreover, a set of interpretable semantic rules are setup to analyze the root cause of performance deterioration among KPIs. An experimental application is proposed to demonstrate its applicability based on the PHM08 data sets. The obtained results show their effectiveness to predict the RULs of machines.",

      "Abstract": "Nowadays, the concept of \"digital twin\" has received great attention from both academia and industry. However, few methodological solutions have been reported in the existing studies. This paper presents a life prediction method for aircraft structure, and illustrates how this method can be embedded into a \"digital twin\" framework. This method can fuse heterogeneous information acquired from inspected physic entity, finite element software, historical database and predictive model, giving an accurate and real-time prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) for aircraft structure. In the operation of this method, the degradation behavior of inspected structure is observed in an online manner. Historical record document is used for generating prior knowledge. The external load condition is fed into finite element software for calculating the stress intensity factor. The well-known paris law is adopted as the predictive model. Finally, the Bayesian inference is used to integrate the information and predict the future degradation of the inspected structure. Theoretical deviation and experiment on a public database demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, facilitating the implementation of \"digital twin\" in real-world scenario.",

      "Title": "Towards Factory Schedule based Adaptation for Reliable Networking in Industrial IoT",
      "Abstract": "In this paper, a novel paradigm of adapting wireless communications based on the factory schedules in an indoor factory floor is explored. Since the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) strengthens the industries with a wide range of advanced applications such as digital twin and predictive maintenance, a large number of devices and systems are deployed densely near machines in a factory floor. Such new devices and systems, along with the existing systems, are networked by the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) wirelessly for their functioning. Devices closer to machines have a greater probability of interference from the operation of the machine. Since the operation of machines in a factory are often scheduled, their impact on wireless communication can be learnt and predicted. The first step towards it is, to estimate the effect of various processes in a factory schedule on wireless communication. This research empirically investigates the extent and nature of the impact of factory schedules and presents its findings. The obtained results indicate that the machines influence the packet reception rate (16% on an average), positively for certain nodes while negatively for others. Furthermore, based on these findings, this paper categorizes the factory schedules into two broad categories ('Macro' and 'Micro' processes) and discusses the challenges in developing a mechanism to detect and classify them. The interference detection and identification can have applications such as scheduling delay-tolerant traffic and adjusting power levels while transmitting a packet apart from increasing reliability of IIoT.",

      "Title": "Lifetime prediction using a tribology-aware, deep learning-based digital twin of ball bearing-like tribosystems in oil and gas",
      "Abstract": "The recent decline in crude oil prices due to global competition and COVID-19-related demand issues has highlighted the need for the efficient operation of an oil and gas plant. One such avenue is accurate predictions about the remaining useful life (RUL) of components used in oil and gas plants. A tribosystem is comprised of the surfaces in relative motion and the lubricant between them. Lubricant oils play a significant role in keeping any tribosystem such as bearings and gears working smoothly over the lifetime of the oil and gas plant. The lubricant oil needs replenishment from time to time to avoid component breakdown due to the increased presence of wear debris and friction between the sliding surfaces of bearings and gears. Traditionally, this oil change is carried out at pre-determined times. This paper explored the possibilities of employing machine learning to predict early failure behavior in sensor-instrumented tribosystems. Specifically, deep learning and tribological data obtained from sensors deployed on the components can provide more accurate predictions about the RUL of the tribosystem. This automated maintenance can improve the overall efficiency of the component. The present study aimed to develop a deep learning-based digital twin for accurately predicting the RUL of a tribosystem comprised of a ball bearing-like test apparatus, a four-ball tester, and lubricant oil. A commercial lubricant used in the offshore oil and gas components was tested for its extreme pressure performance, and its welding load was measured using a four-ball tester. Three accelerated deterioration tests was carried out on the four-ball tester at a load below the welding load. Based on the wear scar measurements obtained from the experimental tests, the RUL data were used to train a multivariate convolutional neural network (CNN). The training accuracy of the model was above 99%, and the testing accuracy was above 95%. This work involved the model-free learning prediction of the remaining useful lifetime of ball bearing-type contacts as a function of key sensor input data (i.e., load, friction, temperature). This model can be deployed for in-field tribological machine elements to trigger automated maintenance without explicitly measuring the wear phenomenon.",

Especially within infrastructure systems of systems and the applications of the internet of things, data became an asset for additional tasks regarding their efficient and effective operations, e.g., predictive maintenance which lowers the total costs of ownership. Many of these tasks are well supported by digital twins but building such digital replicas of systems and processes within a system of system is complicated by that context, e.g., due to the managerial independence of the contributing systems that often restricts available information and data sharing.

      "Abstract": "Vibration sensor is becoming an essential part of Internet of Things (IoT), fueled by the quickly evolving technology improving the measurement accuracy and lowering the hardware cost. Vibration sensors physically attach to core equipments in control and manufacturing systems, e.g., motors and tubes, providing key insight into the running status of these devices. Massive readings from vibration sensors, however, pose new technical challenges to the analytical system, due to the non-continuous sampling strategy for sensor energy saving, as well as hardness of data interpretation. To maximize the utility and minimize the operational overhead of vibration sensors, we propose a new analytical framework, especially designed for vibration analysis based on its unique characteristics. In particular, our data engine targets to support Remaining Usefulness Lifetime (RUL) estimation, known as one of the most important problems in cyber-physical system maintenance, to optimize the replacement scheduling over the equipments under monitoring. Our empirical evaluations on real manufacturing sites show that scalable and accurate analysis over the vibration data enables to prolong the average lifetime of the tubes by 1.2x and reduce the replacement cost by 20%.",

The use of four sensors to measure the cutting force, vibration, acoustic emission, and spindle motor current of an end milling machine is proposed. Sixty-five cutting tests using an end milling machine were conducted, during which sensor data was recorded. The flank wear exhibited on the tool following each cut was then measured using a microscope. This provided a labelled data set on which to train four machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Regression, Random Forests, Feed-Forward Back-Propagation Artificial Neural Networks, and Polynomial Regression. These were then compared and it was found that an artificial neural network provides the most accurate predictions of tool flank wear, with a mean absolute percentage accuracy of 90.11%. Using this trained neural network model, a real-time tool wear prediction system was implemented in LabVIEW. This tool condition monitoring system can be used to increase efficiency of manufacturing processes.",

The simulation of the physics-based tuned model provides all the required data for the RUL calculation via the correlation of the expected (nominal) and the predicted (real) behaviour and functionality of machines' components in the long-term future.

      "Abstract": "Among the tenets of Smart Manufacturing (SM) or Industry 4.0 (I4.0), digital twin (DT), which represents the capabilities of virtual representations of components and systems, has been cited as the biggest technology trend disrupting engineering and design today. DTs have been in use for years in areas such as model-based process control and predictive maintenance, however moving forward a framework is needed that will support the expected pervasiveness of DT technology in the evolution of SM or I4.0. A set of requirements for a DT framework has been derived from analysis of DT definitions, DTs in use today, expected DT applications in the near future, and longer-term DT trends and the DT vision in SM. These requirements include elements of re-usability, interoperability, interchangeability, maintainability, extensibility, and autonomy across the entire DT lifecycle. A baseline framework for DT technology has been developed that addresses many aspects of these requirements and enables the addressing of the requirements more fully through additional specification. The baseline framework includes a definition of a DT and an object-oriented (O-O) architecture for DTs that defines generalization, aggregation and instantiation of DT classes. Case studies using and extending the baseline framework illustrate its advantages in supporting DT solutions and trends in SM.",

      "Abstract": "Digital twins run concurrently with the assets and systems they mirror. They offer real-time execution of advanced control schemes, e.g., for smart buildings, but also various analysis tasks, e.g., for predictive maintenance that ensures resilience. In this, they need to cope with change: The physical twins they mirror operate in a highly dynamic environment with unknown or unexpected variables and impact factors to which they adapt or are adapted to via upgrades, maintenance, or behavioral changes. Keeping digital twins fit for their purpose over their lifecycle is thus a demanding governance challenge that needs to be addressed in tandem with the lifecycle management of the mirrored system. We argue that the best practices of Systems Engineering (SE) and Information Technology (IT), especially software development, need to be brought together to succeed. In this paper, we present a joint SE and IT lifecycle model called the Double Helix model. It highlights the concurrent governance processes of both twins, capturing the temporal dynamics of the environment and the system itself. It accents the important concept of the leading twin. The Double Helix model captures both design and operational phases of SE and management, going from cradle to grave, by empowering a shift from using data in offline simulations during design, to the online operational phase.",

      "Abstract": "Offshore wind turbines are complex systems operating in harsh environment. The dynamic demands in these systems often differ from values used in design, leading to unexpected mechanical and structural failures. This signifies the importance of remote monitoring technologies for damage diagnosis and prognosis in offshore wind turbines. This study is focused on developing mechanics-based digital twins for offshore wind turbine monitoring through a model-updating process using sparse measurement data. Digital twins can be used to estimate the system unmeasured response (i.e., virtual sensing) and to predict the remaining useful fatigue life and failure point of different structural components. A time-domain sequential Bayesian finite element model updating is proposed for mechanics-based digital twinning. This approach is formulated for application to offshore wind turbine and jointly estimates the updating model parameters and the time history of unknown input forces. A classical modal-based model updating followed by modal expansion method is also implemented for comparison. In this approach, updating model parameters are estimated to minimize the discrepancies between the identified and model-predicted modal parameters of the turbine. The performance of these two approaches are studied on a 2-MW offshore wind turbine at the Blyth wind farm in the United Kingdom. Strain response time history at mudline is estimated through both approaches and compared with actual measurements for validation. It is observed that both approaches are capable of accurate response prediction while the Bayesian approach leads to slightly better results. Furthermore, the Bayesian approach allows for identification of input loads and uncertainty quantification.",

Power converter is one of the critical components that undergoes high rate of medium and short term thermal cycles especially in Offshore floating wind turbines compared to fixed bottom turbines. The current study proposes a novel methodology to predict the remaining useful life of an offshore wind turbine power converter in digital twin frame work as a means of predictive maintenance strategy. The remaining useful life is estimated for both diagnostic and prognostic health monitoring specific for offshore operating environment.",

      "Title": "Model-based deterioration estimation with cyber physical system",
      "Abstract": "A key aspect of life cycle management for pursuing sustainability is machine condition prognosis, which requires a condition monitoring system that estimates machine system deterioration to assist engineers in determining which maintenance actions to take. Conventional data-driven methods such as machine learning, have two issues. One is data dependency. The accuracy of a data-driven method depends on the data volume because a data-driven method builds a classification model on the basis of historical data as training data. However, it is difficult to acquire enough data on all deterioration modes, which requires a long time, because deterioration modes are diverse, and some of them rarely happen. The other issue is interpretability. When a condition monitoring system using a data-driven method sends the degree of deterioration (DoD) of the machine system to maintenance engineers, they have difficulty in understanding the results because the method is a black box. The objective of this paper is to address these two issues. We propose a model-based method that simulates machine system deterioration with a cyber physical system (CPS). Model-based methods address these issues in the following manner. First, the methods can simulate the progress of deterioration from an initial condition to failure to estimate the DoD. Second, the methods employ mathematical models that represent machine systems. Engineers create such mathematical models (which we call “physical models”) by referring to various kinds of knowledge like design information and the result of failure mode and effects analysis. A physical model allows us to reason about a machine system to address interpretability. For dealing with machinery that has multiple operation modes, we introduce a state space to clarify the relationship among input, observable state variables, and DoD in a physical model. The CPS estimates DoD by comparing observed data with simulated data in the state space. In our case study, we evaluated our proposed method with a hydraulic pump of a mining machine. First we created a physical model with Modelica, which is a multi-domain modeling language. Then, the method constructed the state space by simulating deterioration with the physical model given all combinations of inputs and DoD. After that, we showed that the estimated DoD tended to increase until the hydraulic pump was replaced, using the observed data from an actual mining machine. As a result, the experimental results revealed that the proposed method succeeded in identifying the DoD with observed data of the hydraulic pump of a mining machine.",

      "Title": "Modular Fault Ascription and Corrective Maintenance Using a Digital Twin",
      "Abstract": "The industrial environment is slowly transforming to a networked system of systems nature with industry 4.0. Automation systems are getting more production friendly by being more reconfigurable and adaptable. The plant engineering process is also getting improved by offering modular architecture, model-based engineering, etc. This transformation necessitates novel methodologies in maintenance practices as well. With the emergence of predictive maintenance techniques, sometimes it is possible to predict a breakdown and thus conveniently schedule the corrective maintenance. But this is not always the case, the incidence of unscheduled corrective maintenance is prevalent in an industrial environment. And the methodologies for corrective maintenance have to be reshaped fitting to the new plant environment. This paper introduces a new modular corrective maintenance methodology, using the digital twin of an automation module. Fault ascription support for a human technician, performing corrective maintenance action of an automation module is provided by its digital twin and associated visual interface. A use case scenario is propounded and future visions are presented.",

The new concept was developed based on experience gained during the implementation of research projects in Poland’s Aviation Valley at aerospace plants such as Pratt & Whitney and Lockheed Martin. Commercial tool condition monitoring (TCM) and production monitoring systems do not effectively meet the requirements and specificity of the aerospace industry. The main objective of the system is real-time diagnostics and sharing of data, knowledge, and system configurations among technologists, line bosses, machine tool operators, and quality control. The concept presented in this paper is a special tool condition monitoring system comprising a three-stage (natural wear, accelerated wear, and catastrophic tool failure) set of diagnostic algorithms designed for short-run machining and aimed at protecting the workpiece from damage by a damaged or worn tool.",

This paper describes the methodologies and the mechanisms which are developed and evaluated for the RUL prediction in PROGRAMS EU project. More specifically, the extend utilization of physics-based models is the main pillar for the prediction of machines' components degradation profiles. An advanced methodology for physics-based modelling was designed in PROGRAMS EU project. The digital models were created while a synchronous tuning mechanism was designed and developed to enable the Digital Twin (DT) concept and eventually to ensure the high accuracy prediction of machines' components future failures. The simulation of the physics-based tuned model provides all the required data for the RUL calculation via the correlation of the expected (nominal) and the predicted (real) behaviour and functionality of machines' components in the long-term future. All the aforementioned activities are integrated in a common framework called “Machines' Behaviour Prediction Tool (BPT) for maintenance applications”.",

      "Abstract": "As industry heads to an era of high productivity and energy efficiency, the manufacturing of robotic manipulators moves far from the traditionally heavy and stiff structures. Therefore, rigid body dynamic models become obsolete and the need for new dynamic models accounting for the flexibility of industrial manipulators emerges. To this end, a physics-based approach considering the flexibility of robots' links and gearboxes is presented. In particular, this paper intends to provide a framework for modelling flexible robotic structures' towards increasing their accuracy. The robot components' elasticity is introduced in a lumped parameters model by pairs of springs and dampers, the number of which is affected by the target of keeping the computational effort and run time of the simulation at levels allowing for the integration of the model in industrial environments. Finally, the proposed model considers the activation of the robots' Digital Twins aiming to enable the use of the model in a series of applications e.g. predictive maintenance, energy efficiency optimization etc.",

      "Abstract": "Manufacturing systems are making a shift towards intelligent and predictive Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) with enhanced sensing and communication capabilities. Current maintenance activities are based on predefined schedules, without considering the working state of the equipment and thus leading to over-maintained machinery. The cost related to the production process interruption and for dispatching maintenance personnel to restore the equipment to proper working conditions is high. In this context, this study presents an extendable and re-usable scheduling approach supporting multiple heterogeneous inputs and outputs. Predictive maintenance indicators from the monitored equipment are used for scheduling maintenance operations in line with the existing schedule. A web-service architecture is adopted towards supporting highly different use-cases, such as equipment providers and/or manufacturers. The incorporation of maintenance activities to the production schedule may result in a reduction of maintenance breakdowns and thus increased productivity. The proposed approach has been applied to cases deriving from the automotive and steel production industries.",

      "Abstract": "In recent years, Digital Twins (DT) have been implemented in different industrial sectors, in several applications areas such as design, production, manufacturing, and maintenance. In particular, maintenance is one of the most researched applications, as the impact of the execution of maintenance task may have a great impact in the business of the companies. For example, in sector such as energy or manufacturing, a maintenance activity can cause the shutdown of an entire production line, or in the case of a wind turbine inspection, may face the safety of an operator to measure a simple indicator. Hence, the application of more intelligent maintenance strategies can offer huge benefits. In this context, this paper focuses on the review of DT applications for maintenance, as no previous work has been found with this aim. For instance, both “Digital Twin” and “maintenance” concepts and strategies are described in detail, and then a literature review is carried out where these two concepts are involved. In addition to identifying and analyzing how DTs are currently being applied for maintenance, this paper also highlights future research lines and open issues.",

      "Abstract": "A Digital Twin is one of the enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 that couples actual physical systems with corresponding virtual representation. Currently, the application of Digital Twin models has attracted the attention of many researchers with the focus of production, predictive maintenance, and after-sale services. However, its role in industrial operations particularly in production, predictive maintenance, and after-sales services lacks efforts to systematically review the state-of-the-art. Moreover, this review discusses some of the challenges in implementing DT models to extend its role in the aforementioned application domains. In this paper, a systematic literature review was conducted to assess the role of Digital Twin models in industrial operations and to identify challenges for realization. Twenty-five research studies that were published until the end of June 2019 were selected and analyzed in order to show the current state-of-the-art on the role of Digital Twin models in the industrial operations and challenges in the implementation. Review results underline that the majority of the studies have focused on the application of Digital Twins in the production sector followed by predictive maintenance and after-sales services. Many authors have discussed how to apply Digital Twin models without remarking their role in the aforementioned domains of industrial operations. This paper provides insights for different industrial sectors, practitioners, researchers and experts of the field on the specific roles of Digital Twin models and challenges of implementing these models in the areas of production, predictive maintenance, and after-sale services.",

      "Abstract": "Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) has supported the industry in its transition from trial-and-error towards physics-based modelling, but our ways of treating and exploiting the simulation results have changed little during this period. Indeed, the business model of CAE centers almost exclusively around delivering base-case simulation results with a few additional operational conditions. In this contribution, we introduce a new paradigm for the exploitation of computational physics data, consisting in using machine learning to enlarge the simulation databases in order to cover a wider spectrum of operational conditions and provide quick response directly on field. The resulting product from this hybrid physics-informed and data-driven modelling is referred to as Simulation Digital Twin (SDT). While the paradigm can be equally used in different CAE applications, in this paper we address its implementation in the context of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). We show that the generation of Simulation Digital Twins can be efficiently accomplished with the combination of the CFD tool TransAT and the data analytics platform eDAP.",

      "Title": "On digital twin condition monitoring approach for drivetrains in marine applications",
      "Abstract": "A digital twin is a virtual representation of a system containing all information available on site. This paper presents condition monitoring of drivetrains in marine power transmission systems through digital twin approach. A literature review regarding current operations concerning maintenance approaches in todays practices are covered. State-of-the-art fault detection in drivetrains is discussed, founded in condition monitoring, data-based schemes and model-based approaches, and the digital twin approach is introduced. It is debated that a model-based approach utilizing a digital twin could be recommended for fault detection of drivetrains. By employing a digital twin, fault detection would be extended to relatively highly diagnostic and predictive maintenance programme, and operation and maintenance costs could be reduced. A holistic model system approach is considered, and methodologies of digital twin design are covered. A physical-based model rather than a data based model is considered, however there are no clear answer whereas which type is beneficial. That case is mostly answered by the amount of data available. Designing the model introduces several pitfalls depending on the relevant system, and the advantages, disadvantages and appropriate applications are discussed. For a drivetrain it is found that multi-body simulation is advised for the creation of a digital twin model. A digital twin of a simple drivetrain test rig is made, and different modelling approaches were implemented to investigate levels of accuracy. Reference values were derived empirically by attaching sensors to the drivetrain during operation in the test rig. Modelling with a low fidelity model showed high accuracy, however it would lack several modules required for it to be called a digital twin. The higher fidelity model showed that finding the stiffness parameter proves challenging, due to high stiffness sensitivity as the experimental modelling demonstrates. Two industries that could have significant benefits from implementing digital twins are discussed; the offshore wind industry and shipping. Both have valuable assets, with reliability sensitive systems and high costs of downtime and maintenance. Regarding the shipping industry an industrial case study is done. Area of extra focus is operations of Ro-Ro (roll onroll off) vessels. The vessels in the case study are managed by Wilhelmsen Ship Management and a discussion of the implementation of digital twins in this sector is comprised in this article.",

      "Abstract": "Autonomy has become a focal point for research and development in many industries. Whilst this was traditionally achieved by modelling self-engineering behaviours at the component-level, efforts are now being focused on the sub-system and system-level through advancements in artificial intelligence. Exploiting its benefits requires some innovative thinking to integrate overarching concepts from big data analysis, digitisation, sensing, optimisation, information technology, and systems engineering. With recent developments in Industry 4.0, machine learning and digital twin, there has been a growing interest in adapting these concepts to achieve autonomous maintenance; the automation of predictive maintenance scheduling directly from operational data and for in-built repair at the systems-level. However, there is still ambiguity whether state-of-the-art developments are truly autonomous or they simply automate a process. In light of this, it is important to present the current perspectives about where the technology stands today and indicate possible routes for the future. As a result, this effort focuses on recent trends in autonomous maintenance before moving on to discuss digital twin as a vehicle for decision making from the viewpoint of requirements, whilst the role of AI in assisting with this process is also explored. A suggested framework for integrating digital twin strategies within maintenance models is also discussed. Finally, the article looks towards future directions on the likely evolution and implications for its development as a sustainable technology.",

Digital twin in this context consists of torsional dynamic model, online measurements and fatigue damage estimation which is used for remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. At first, methods for system parameter estimation are presented. The digital twin model provides sufficient inputs for the load observers designed in specific points of the drivetrain to estimate the online load and subsequently stress in the different components. The estimated real-time stress values feed the degradation model of the components. The stochastic degradation model proposed for estimation of real-time fatigue damage in the components is based on a proven model-based approach which is tested under different drivetrain operations, namely normal, faulty and overload conditions. The uncertainties in model, measurements and material properties are addressed, and confidence interval for the estimations is provided by a detailed analysis on the signal behavior and using Monte Carlo simulations. A test case, using 10 MW drivetrain, has been demonstrated.",

This has realized the need for artificial intelligence tools for robust data processing. However, the large size of input data requires real time monitoring and synchronization for online analysis. As the star concept behind the Industry 4.0 wave, a digital twin is a virtual, multi-scale and probabilistic simulation to mirror the performance of its physical counterpart and serve the product lifecycle in a virtual space. Evidently, a digital twin can proactively identify potential issues with its corresponding real twin. Thus, it is best suited for enabling a physics-based and data-driven model fusion to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of the components. Traditional RUL prediction approaches have assumed either an exponential or linear degradation trend with a fixed curve shape to build a Health Index (HI) model. Such an assumption may not be useful for multi-sensor systems or cases where sensor data is available intermittently. A common constraint in the industry is irregular sensor data collection. The resulting asynchronous time series of the sporadic data needs to be an accurate representation of the component's HI when constructing a degradation model. In this paper, we extend the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) technique to generate RUL prediction within a digital twin framework as a means of synchronization with changing operational states. More specifically, we first use LSTM encoder-decoder (LSTM-ED) to train a multilayered neural network and reconstruct the sensor data time series corresponding to a healthy state. The resulting reconstruction error can be used to capture patterns in input data time series and estimate HI of training and testing sets. Using a time lag to record similarity between the HI curves, a weighted average of the final RUL estimation is obtained. The described empirical approach is evaluated on publicly available engine degradation dataset with run-to-failure information. Results indicate a high RUL estimation accuracy with greater error reduction rate. This demonstrates wide applicability of the discussed methodology to various industries where event data is scarce for the application of only data-driven techniques.",

This RUL is used to planned the maintenance operation to avoid the failure, the stop time and optimize the cost of the maintenance and failure. However, with the development of the industry the assets are nowadays distributed this is why the PHM needs to be developed using the new IT. In our work we propose a PHM solution based on Cyber physical system where the physical side is connected to the analyze process of the PHM which are developed in the cloud to be shared and to benefit of the cloud characteristics.",

      "Abstract": "Predictive maintenance is one of the important technical means to guarantee and improve the normal industrial production. The existing bottlenecks for popularization and application are analyzed. In order to solve these problems, a cooperative awareness and interconnection framework across multiple organizations for total factors that affect prediction maintenance decision-making is discussed. Initially, the structure and operation mechanism of this framework are proposed. It is designed to support the sharing of data, knowledge and resources. As a key supporting technology, the digital twin is also integrated into it to improve the accuracy of fault diagnosis and prediction and support making a maintenance plan with higher accuracy and reliability. Then, under this framework, an integrated mathematical programming model is established with considering the parameter uncertainty and an NSGA-II hybrid algorithm is utilized to solve it. Moreover, an adjustment strategy for a maintenance plan is discussed in response to the dynamic characteristics of the actual maintenance environment. Finally, a case, prediction maintenance decision-making for bearings in grinding rolls of the large vertical mill, is studied. Analysis results verify the advantage of the integrated solving mechanism based on the proposed framework. The framework and integrated decision-making approach can guide the implementation of predictive maintenance with higher accuracy and reliability for industrial enterprises.",

      "Title": "Prediction of bearing remaining useful life with deep convolution neural network",
      "Abstract": "Cyber-physical-social system (CPSS) has drawn tremendous attention in industrial applications such as industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). As the fundamental component of IIoT, bearings play an increasingly important role in CPSS for IIoT. Better understanding of bearing working conditions and degradation patterns so as to more accurately predict the remaining useful life (RUL), becomes an urgent demand for industrial prognostics in IIoT. The data-driven approach has indicated good potential, but the prediction accuracy is still not satisfactory. This paper proposes a new method for the prediction of bearing RUL based on deep convolution neural network (CNN). A new feature extraction method is presented to obtain the eigenvector, named the spectrum-principal-energy-vector. The eigenvector is suitable for deep CNN. In the prediction phase, we propose a smoothing method to deal with the discontinuity problem found in the prediction results. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose such a smoothing method for bearing RUL prediction. Experiments show that our method can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of bearing RUL.",

      "Abstract": "The role of a Digital Twin is increasingly discussed within the context of Cyber-Physical Production Systems. Accordingly, various architectures for the realization of Digital Twin use cases are conceptualized. There lacks, however, a clear, encompassing architecture covering necessary components of a Digital Twin to realize various use cases in an intelligent automation system. In this contribution, the added value of a Digital Twin in an intelligent automation system is highlighted and various existing definitions and architectures of the Digital Twin are discussed. Flowingly, an architecture for a Digital Twin and an architecture for an Intelligent Digital Twin and their required components are proposed, with which use cases such as plug and produce, self-x and predictive maintenance are enabled. In the opinion of the authors, a Digital Twin requires three main characteristics: Synchronization with the real asset, active data acquisition from the real environment and the ability of simulation. In addition to all the characteristics of a Digital Twin, an Intelligent Digital Twin must also include the characteristics of Artificial Intelligence. The Intelligent Digital Twin can be used for the realization of the autonomous Cyber-Physical Production Systems. In order to realize the proposed architecture for a Digital Twin, several methods, namely the Anchor-Point-Method, a method for heterogeneous data acquisition and data integration as well as an agent-based method for the development of a co-simulation between Digital Twins were implemented and evaluated.",

      "Abstract": "1.1 Environmental Impact and Challenges in the Built Environment Reducing the amount of resources that are used in the creation, maintenance and use of the Built Environment from buildings to infrastructure is a key factor in achieving the climate goals. A vast amount of primary resources is spent during the construction of buildings, which uses 50% of raw materials taken from earth. The energy needed to heat, cool, illuminate, connect the fabric of the built environment contributes 36% to global energy use and 39% of energy-related CO2 emissions. At the same time, the building industry is one of the most fragmented, decen-tralized and diverse industries with nearly 3 million workers organized in 800.000 predominantly small enterprises. The vast spectrum of trades and sub-domains along with the diversity of its products ranging from residential buildings to tun-nels and bridges leads to a wide spectrum of information exchanged in temporary processes with fragile value chains. At the same time, the building sector as a whole is trailing in many productivity indices and in its state of digitalization. The potential to save energy and to contribute to the reduction of the car-bon footprint from the sector can be approached from a number of different angles: Improved design and planning for the few new and the many existing buildings; re-use and circular economy for the materials involved and synergetic effects through increased vertical and horizontal integration of processes, and subsystems. All this requires the integration of knowledge domains. 1.2 Semantic DTs in the Built Environment The individual cyberphysical sub-systems that comprise the built environment from individual buildings to vast and highly connected infrastructure networks including traffic, energy, water and waste networks, are designed, operated and maintained in completely separated, heterogeneous information silos with a very low rate of digitalization. Representing, monitoring, simulating and optimizing even of single nodes in these interconnected, multi-layered networks using dig-ital twins has only just begun. Within a single domain of these networks such as an individual building, a road-network or bridge, the current and past sys-tem states, their long-term monitoring and improvement requires comprehensive semantic models digital twin models. Such models are still in their infancy. Cur-rent and evolving information models are still mostly designed to capture static as-planned individual lifecycle stages, have bespoke and disparate insular solu-tions and little to no vertical and horizontal connectivity with other nodes in the network. Information exchange models for different aspects at various levels of granularity from geospatial superstructures (GIS) to building components (BIM) often have hundreds or even thousands of semantic entities and the sheer size of the structured vocabularies to describe products range in the tens of thousands of concepts which often differ on national or even regional levels. 1.3 Use cases and examples In the presentation an overview of ongoing research, development and standard-ization efforts regarding the creation, integration and interoperability of seman-tic Digital Twins for the built environment is provided. Concrete challenges and solution approaches of past and ongoing research from different use cases and application domains of Semantic Digital Twins for-the assessment and energy refurbishing of residential buildings-monitoring and predictive maintenance of bridges-road network interoperability with Linked Data across European borders are used to illustrate these challenges. These include the semantic lifting of legacy data models, the alignment and integration of vast domain vocabularies, multi-modal integration of heterogeneous status information (sensor, images, measure-ments) and ongoing efforts to create reference frameworks for semantically rich Digital Twins in the built environment.",

We claim that these directions can be effectively and efficiently addressed through the adoption of innovative quality-aware edge cloud computing platforms for the design, implementation, and runtime support of distributed AI solutions that execute on both global cloud resources and edge nodes in industrial plant premises. In particular, the paper presents the first experiences that we are doing within the framework of the H2020 Innovation Action IoTwins, for the implementation and optimization of distributed hybrid twins in the IIoT application domains of predictive maintenance and manufacturing optimization. IoTwins exploits distributed hybrid twins, partly executing at edge cloud nodes in industrial plant localities, to perform process/fault predictions and manufacturing line reconfigurations under time constraints, also by enabling some forms of sovereignty on industrial monitoring data. In addition, the paper overviews our original taxonomy of the stateof-the-art research literature about distributed AI for decentralized learning, with specific focus on federated settings and on emerging trends for the IIoT domain.",

Predictive maintenance is an approach that aims to schedule maintenance tasks based on historical data in order to avoid machine failures and reduce the costs due to unnecessary maintenance actions. Approaches for the implementation of a maintenance solution often differ depending on the kind of data to be analyzed and on the techniques and models adopted for the failure forecasts and for maintenance decision-making. Nowadays, Industry 4.0 introduces a flexible and adaptable manufacturing concept to satisfy a market requiring an increasing demand for customization. The adoption of vendor-specific solutions for predictive maintenance and the heterogeneity of technologies adopted in the brownfield for the condition monitoring of machinery reduce the flexibility and interoperability required by Industry 4.0. In this paper a novel approach for the definition of a generic and technology-independent model for predictive maintenance is presented. Such model leverages on the concept of the Reference Architecture Model for Industry (RAMI) 4.0 Asset Administration Shell, as a means to achieve interoperability between different devices and to implement generic functionalities for predictive maintenance.",

      "Abstract": "Predictive maintenance in a manufacturing company is strategic, in order to maintain high production quality and to avoid unexpected production downtimes. In this scenario, the prediction of future machineries health status is necessary in order to plan maintenance cycles and to optimize the production. The proposed approach relies on the use of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) techniques mapped from the electronic domain to the production line domain. This paper proposes a general framework based on the EDA approach that allows to set-up a maintenance strategy by analyzing data retrieved from sensors. An MSM, is associated to each observable measurement, while a Supervisor monitors the current state of each Monitoring State Machine (MSM) by raising alerts when the monitored equipment is deviating from its normal behavior. This framework is the Digital-Twin of the plant devoted to its monitoring. It has some execution modalities ranging from online monitoring to predictive maintenance. The methodology has been applied to a mechanical transmission system showing its effectiveness.",

For the implementation of such a multi-stage prediction, the proposed approach includes two prediction layers: the cloud prediction layer and the local prediction layer. Each layer provides a prediction of machine health status in different timescale. The local prediction layer, based on data analysis techniques, is responsible for predicting the health status of the machine for a short time period. The cloud prediction layer, based on digital physical-based models, is responsible for providing a more general overview of machine health status using Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) techniques, useful for long time span strategies definition. The chapter also presents the proposed approach and describes its benefits. The proposed approach is implemented in the PROGRAMS project.",

      "Abstract": "1The Environmental Control System (ECS) of an aircraft is responsible for regulating and conditioning the airflow into the cockpit, cabin and avionics bay. The ECS is composed of several complex sub-systems and components that are reported as key unscheduled maintenance drivers for legacy aircraft by aircraft operators. Furthermore, the incorporated temperature and flow control valves in these sub-systems have the capability to mask potential faults at the component level, making the diagnostic process very challenging. To overcome this challenge, the aviation industry is currently proactively exploring the predictive maintenance approach that allows real-time monitoring of the key systems, sub-systems and components. In the context of the ECS, this necessitates the requirement to equip the system with appropriate condition monitoring capabilities. To do this, the performance characteristics of the ECS at sub-system and component level needs to be well understood under a wide range of aircraft operating scenarios. Existing literature provides both the component-level and system-level analyses of the ECS. However, it lacks an experimentally verified and validated ECS sub-system and component level simulation tool (ECS Digital Twin), capable of simulating the thermodynamic performance and component health state parameters under wide-ranging aircraft operational scenarios. The ECS Digital Twin (DT) developed by the Cranfield University IVHM Centre offers the capability to simulate healthy and faulty cases of the Passenger Air Conditioner (PACK). This paper proposes a methodology for full-scale experimental Verification & Validation (V&V) of the developed ECS DT, to enable component-level simulation, and enabling accurate diagnostics, of the civil aircraft ECS. The paper reports on progress to date in this project.",

      "Abstract": "An intelligent combination of the Internet of Things (IoT) and approaches to modeling and simulation is one of the most challenging endeavors for future cities, manufacturing industries, and predictive maintenance. Digital Twins take on a unique role here. However, the question of what a Digital Twin is and what differentiates it from a regular model is still open. We present an experimental setup for integrating an existing simulation model of Hamburg's traffic system with the city's real-time sensor network. The Digital Twin is implemented using the large-scale multi-agent framework MARS. The entire process from the model description to retrieving real-time data from the IoT sensors and incorporating it in the simulation is presented. As a first prototypical example, a multi-modal mobility model was connected to real-world bike-sharing locations in Hamburg. We find that the combination of multi-agent systems and IoT sensors as a Digital Twin shows enormous potential for city planners, policy stakeholders, and other decision-makers. By correcting the course of a simulation via real-time data, the corridor-of-uncertainty that is intrinsic to some simulation models' use can be reduced significantly. Furthermore, any divergence of simulated and sampled data can lead to a deeper understanding of complex adaptive systems like big cities.",

      "Abstract": "The present paper describes the state of the art related to IIoT Devices and Cyber-Physical systems and presents a use case related to predictive maintenance. Industry 4.0 is the boost for smart manufacturing and demands flexibility and adaptability of all devices/machines in the shop floor. The machines must become smart and interact with other machines inside and outside the industries/factories. The predictive maintenance is a key topic in this industrial revolution. The reason is based on the idea that smart machines must be capable to automatically identify and predict possible faults and actuate before they occur. Vibrations can be problematic in electrical motors. For this reason, we address an experimental study associated with an automatic classification procedure, Based on two distinct architectures to detect anomalies: National Instruments acquisition board and an Arduino board with an EtherCAT Shield. With the implementation of a supervised learning model, both approaches corroborate the applicability and usefulness of this machine learning algorithm to predict vibration faults.",

      "Title": "Artificial intelligence in autonomous operation of oil and gas facilities",
      "Abstract": "Objectives/Scope: Remote, inaccessible locations, hazardous environments and cost are some of the drivers for unmanned or remotely-operated facilities. With insight from facilities which are already operating remotely, it is time to take the next step towards running autonomous plants with no people. With reference to external sources and client case studies, this paper will discuss the preconditions and technological developments which now make it possible to do this safely and economically and how Artificial Intelligence is a key component. Methods, Procedures, Process: The paper describes key criteria and technologies needed for successful autonomous operations. In particular, companies must ensure operations are safe through process safety management. They must also be able to run operations with no physical presence via automatic controls for startup, change and shutdown. Maintenance and inspection must also be done with no-one there, using plant-wide condition monitoring and predictive analytics, as opposed to only tracking critical equipment as the latter is insufficient in processes with so many interdependencies. Robots and drones must also be leveraged where manned intervention is required e.g. for pipeline scraper handling. Results, Observations, Conclusions: The importance of zero operators is significant. Even just one employee, actually means 20 are needed for a site running all day, every day by the time rest, vacation and sick leave cover requirements are factored in, not to mention support functions like catering and cleaning. This is not only expensive but also means a significant number of people remain exposed to a hazardous working environment. Underpinning the above are Internet of things technologies to sense, measure and control operations, connectivity to share the information in a timely manner, the analytics to process it - with a significant reliance on artificial intelligence- and appropriate dashboards to bring the information to the remote operator, domain expert or vendor partner. The importance of digital engineering and digital twins in facilitating such activities will also be discussed. Novel/Additive Information: We show that new safety, operational and maintenance procedures are needed to implement autonomous unmanned operation. Artificial intelligence with machine learning is needed to reach this goal. The paper will provide examples of howunmanned operations are becoming a reality. The safety and cost-saving benefits achieved from pilots and wider field applications of technology will be presented. Many of the technologies and operational changes will in themselves deliver reduced costs by eliminating operator errors, reducing maintenance expenditure and improving availability.",

      "Abstract": "The food industry has improved product quality while reducing production time and cost by automating production using programmable logic controllers (PLC) over the last several decades. However, many production plants still require some level of manual expert interaction, mainly because the production processes are not 100% under control. Operators are often still present to take quality samples, re-tune unit operation controls or resolve failures. The use of a physics-based “Digital Twin” is getting more and more traction to develop the equipment virtually due to the improvements in prediction accuracy and speed of computation. Digital twins allow engineers to find the optimal design before the unit goes into production. However, these digital twins can’t be deployed at the operational level because they can be complex or too slow to react at the speed of operation. In this contribution a new set of solutions that lowers the barrier in executing the digital twins on the production floor is explain based on a few examples. This will deliver substantial return on investment (ROI) for the food production industry. They include technologies such as: • A machine learning based methodology to perform Model Order Reduction (MOR) on the digital twin in order to get real time response based on production information. • A machine learning based methodology to convert the reduced model into a virtual sensor for online quality predictions or predictive maintenance scheduling as well as to use it for creating an optimal controller of the unit based on the product requirements. • Fast edge computing hardware that can collect data from sensors and run the Executable Digital Twin (xDT) to suggest corrective action to the operator, in real time, or ultimately run in closed loop control.",

      "Title": "Unmanned full processing platforms; Using subsea technology as enabler",
      "Abstract": "Offshore full-processing platforms are permanently manned due to the large number of operational and maintenance tasks. Having these platforms unmanned and remotely operated would improve the field economy, reduce the personnel risk and minimize the environmental footprint. The use of subsea mindset and technology in the platform design can enable such a shift in the manning and operations regime. Unmanned platforms have been in operation for decades in the form of simple platforms without complex process functions. The frequency of visits has however, turned out to be quite high. Further, maintaining facilities as unmanned has proved challenging when processing functions are added. To enable full-processing platforms to operate as unmanned installations, a new approach to design can be adopted. This new approach is characterized by use of design principles for complex subsea processing facilities and benefitting from the digital revolution. A main difference when comparing subsea and topside processing facilities is the significant number of utilities, support and safety functions on a platform. For the new platform concept proposed, several of these functions are simplified or eliminated, which reduces complexity, the need for maintenance and cost. The platform concept is among others proposed without accommodation and helideck. Access by personnel and evacuation is via bridge to Service Operation Vessel. By examining the Mean Time Between Failure for topside vs subsea equipment, it is evident that the subsea equipment has higher availability and requires less maintenance. For the topside equipment which as of today is maintenance intensive, e.g. compressors and pumps, the concept includes using subsea derived equipment. Seal-less subsea derived compressors are already proven for topside application. The maintenance need is determined based on surveillance by sensors and predictive analytics, i.e. predictive maintenance. On a staffed facility there are cranes and trolleys for material handling and personnel are carrying out in-situ inspection and repairs, representing a significant number of offshore man-hours. For Subsea installations, the principle is plug & play replacement by use of intervention vessels. The layout of the new platform concept is arranged in a subsea derived manner adopting the replacement principle by use of vessels. Also, the platform is proposed with robotics tailored for intervention of minor items. New technologies as drones and crawlers are developing rapidly and are used for inspection tasks replacing personnel, in addition to sensors and cameras and in combination with a digital twin. These technologies are comparable to using ROV for inspection of subsea equipment. This paper will present the conceptual idea for the subsea derived full-processing unmanned platform in more detail, and discuss benefits compared to a conventional staffed full-processing platform.",

      "Title": "Industry 4.0: Why Machine Learning Matters?",
      "Abstract": "Machine Learning is at the forefront of the Industry 4.0 revolution. Both the amount and complexity of data generated by sensors make interpretation and ingestion of data beyond human capability. It is impossible for engineers to optimise an extremely complex production line and to understand which unit or machine is responsible for quality or productivity degradation! It is extremely difficult for engineers to process monitoring or inspection data as it requires a protocol, a trained and certified engineer as well as experience! It is extremely difficult to guarantee the quality of every single product particularly at high production rates! Artificial Intelligence can help answering the above questions. Indeed, machine learning can be used for predictive or condition-based maintenance. Even without knowing the design of the machine (i.e., gearbox stages, bearing design, etc.), a machine learning algorithm is capable to monitor deviation of monitoring sensors features compared to a healthy state. Machine learning can be used to monitor the quality of production by allowing the automation of the quality control process. Monitoring additive manufacturing process to detect defects during printing and allow mitigation through real-time machining and reprinting of the defective area. Ensuring the quality of very complex and sensitive production processes such as MEMS, electronic wafers, solar cells or OLED screens. Brunel Innovation Centre (BIC) is working on developing algorithms combining statistical, signal/image processing for features extraction and deep learning for automated defect recognition for quality control and for predictive maintenance. Brunel Innovation Centre is also working on integrating those technologies into the digital twin.",

      "Title": "Implementation of a Digital Twin Starting with a Simulator",
      "Abstract": "The term complete Digital Twin describes a digital entity following and taking part in the life of a system, from its design during its regular use, up until its end of life. It is a coherent set of interoperable modules that will be used depending on the state of progress of the system. Since the Digital Twin follows the system from its design to its end of life, it can be a powerful lifecycle management tool. In this framework, it seems too complicated to try integrating all the modules simultaneously. It’s important to prioritize them and build an expandable architecture. One of the major criterion is ensuring the digital continuity in order to implement a sustainable model for the Industry 4.0. The modules used after-sales, such as the predictive maintenance module, are harder to implement, because the connection/communication with the system after delivery must be managed which is not always possible. Therefore, the modules that are the easiest to implement are the ones before-sales, because they are integrally managed internally. This study is conducted in a medium size enterprise which allows us to address in a concrete way the deployment of a digital twin in the industrial activities. The deployment strategy needs to be combined in order to prevent the features of the digital twin to be perceived as a hindrance. This study focuses on the development of a simulator that will link up offer design, detailed design and assembly/manufacturing follow up.",

      "Title": "Intelligent Digital Twin System in the Semiconductors Manufacturing Industry",
      "Abstract": "The introduction of Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things (IoT) in the manufacturing industry has widely contributed to improving the underlying processes. It will usher the doors towards the implementation of newer emerging technologies such as Smart Manufacturing and Digital Twin technologies (DT). This chapter highlights aspects of a new design for an intelligent system which involves the creation of a DT system within the semiconductor manufacturing area. The system will also include designing intelligent agents, we name them as Intelligent Digital Humming tool (IDH) tool. A design for a robust automated system is also proposed to provide a high level of convergence and synchronization between the developed DT and the physical manufacturing plant. On this basis, the chapter provides a new approach that is going to help an international semiconductor manufacturing company to digitize and automate their physical production process. Furthermore, this project aims to design a high-level application that allows engineers to facilitate their product design, improve their planning and incorporate predictive maintenance. This paper aims to overcome the heterogeneity, connectivity and automation challenges of designing an automated DT that controls the physical manufacturing processes. Also, a novel new Intelligent Digital Humming tool (IDH) is proposed to tackle the traditional digital twin automation challenges.",

      "Title": "Model order reduction and digital twins",
      "Abstract": "We are currently facing a substantial transformation of our industrial world and the way our economics are organized. This transformation, known as digitalization, is driven by the systemic integration of information technology in all kinds of devices, machines, and factories such that new smart networks are formed and new smart products have the ability to monitor, to forecast, and to control their behavior. One of the fundamental pillars of digitalization is simulation technology, since it enables the new intelligence layer in the form of digital twins which mirror the physical systems into the digital world - also named by Gartner Inc. as a top technology trend for 2017 and 2018. Creating such intelligence layers over several domains and life cycle phases requires, among other challenges, technologies for transforming and reducing complex simulation models. Exactly for this task a key technology is model order reduction (MOR). However, MOR is not only a key technology within emerging digital twins but also helps to reduce simulation times in the existing everyday business of simulation engineers. This is especially important when for a simulation model a large number of evaluations are needed. Within this chapter we present use cases where MOR is a key enabler for the realization of digital services and the reduction of simulation times. Furthermore we outline the potential of MOR in the context of realizing the digital twin vision.",

      "Abstract": "Nearly every part of every solar farm in the world is currently collecting massive amounts of data, and in nearly all cases, nothing significant is being done with it. GE is working to develop predictive maintenance capabilities via digital twins, and the solar products company SunLink has developed an intelligent torque rod that can cut production costs for its tracking systems and software that has the potential to cut operations and maintenance costs. Connecting solar plants is of particular importance due to their size. The location of many utility-scale power plants also makes it critical that the solar industry adopt intelligent technology. Many utility-scale solar plants are located hours into the desert, making them hard to get too if anything goes wrong. The ability to predict problems and correct them remotely would be extremely helpful.",

      "Title": "Introduction to Predictive Models for Motor Dielectric Aging",
      "Abstract": "Standardized testing methods are generally utilized to assess in service dielectric material aging and over time use of this information allows one to become knowledgeable as to the condition of the motor, and ultimately, when to repair the machine prior to failure. Traditional accelerated aging experiments are performed to evaluate base dielectric materials for properties such as thermal class and the ability to withstand voltage over time. Physical models for dielectric aging have also been developed. Emulators (aka predictive models) are statistical models trained using advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms to capture the input/output relationships of an underlying system or data set. Once trained, the emulator can be used in lieu of the process that generated the training data to rapidly predict outputs for arbitrary input combinations. Emulators can be created of both deterministic physics-based simulation codes and physical or experimental processes. Using a simple physical motor model, the process of building an emulator will be illustrated. This process begins with a design of experiments to select input combinations for the experimental collection of training data from the physical model. The emulator's predictive accuracy can be iteratively improved through an adaptive design process that combines knowledge of the previously conducted experiments with the emulator's ability to assess areas of greatest uncertainty in its predictions. The final validated emulator can be used for sensitivity analyses of inputs on the output(s) of interest, uncertainty propagation, and optimization. Applications of emulators include virtual sensors, predictive maintenance, calibration of physics-based simulation models, and digital twins. Avenues of application for an emulator of a motor model include predictions of motor life and dielectric failure probabilities based on dielectric and insulation material properties.",

Data-driven models for the analysis of production systems are becoming increasingly important in industry. The main advantages of their use are that the generation of Digital Shadows is only based on measured sensor data and existing data interfaces and analysis methods can be used for predictions. However, data-driven approaches have their limits, as they only extrapolate trends from past events. Relevant data on failure scenarios that have not occurred in reality are often missing. Therefore, there is a need for Digital Twins for analysis purposes, which combine data-driven and physics-based models to enable representative predictive statements such as the Remaining Useful life of machine components. In the EU-funded project Z-BRE4K, approaches to harmonize data-driven and physics-based models for predictive maintenance are researched, developed and tested together with industrial users. These approaches are presented in this paper.",

      "Title": "Estimating the characteristic curve of a directional control valve in a combined multibody and hydraulic system using an augmented discrete extended kalman filter",
      "Abstract": "The estimation of the parameters of a simulation model such that the model’s behaviour matches closely with reality can be a cumbersome task. This is due to the fact that a number of model parameters cannot be directly measured, and such parameters might change during the course of operation in a real system. Friction between different machine components is one example of these parameters. This can be due to a number of reasons, such as wear. Nevertheless, if one is able to accurately define all necessary parameters, essential information about the performance of the system machinery can be acquired. This information can be, in turn, utilised for product-specific tuning or predictive maintenance. To estimate parameters, the augmented discrete extended Kalman filter with a curve fitting method can be used, as demonstrated in this paper. In this study, the proposed estimation algorithm is applied to estimate the characteristic curves of a directional control valve in a four-bar mechanism actuated by a fluid power system. The mechanism is modelled by using the double-step semi-recursive multibody formulation, whereas the fluid power system under study is modelled by employing the lumped fluid theory. In practise, the characteristic curves of a directional control valve is described by three to six data control points of a third-order B-spline curve in the augmented discrete extended Kalman filter. The results demonstrate that the highly non-linear unknown characteristic curves can be estimated by using the proposed parameter estimation algorithm. It is also demonstrated that the root mean square error associated with the estimation of the characteristic curve is 0.08% with respect to the real model. In addition, all the errors in the estimated states and parameters of the system are within the 95% confidence interval. The estimation of the characteristic curve in a hydraulic valve can provide essential information for performance monitoring and maintenance applications.",

Therefore, system manufactures need to efficiently provide system operators so-called digital twins which can be executed during operation and give the system operator an impression of the health state of the system. Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platforms are enablers for such services and provide new possibilities to interact with the system running in the field. Furthermore, the traditional dashboard are becoming obsolete as user interface and are replaced by novel solutions that let the system operator experience the system health state. For example, health estimation and condition monitoring of electric motors is a topic of high interest nowadays. This article addresses an application which acquires machine data, processes it on an IIoT platform to get the system health and visualizes the results online in an augmented reality user interface.",

      "Abstract": "Nowadays, data is considered as a new life force for operations of physical systems in various domains such as manufacturing, healthcare, transportations, etc. However, the hugely generated data, which mirrors the working essence of the product life cycle, is still underutilised. Digital Twin (DT), a collective representation of active and passive captured data, is a virtual counterpart of the physical resources that could help prevent effective preventive maintenance in any applied domain. Currently, lots of research is going on about the applicability of digital twin in smart IOT based manufacturing industry 4.0 environment. Still, it lacks a formal study, which can provide a bird's eye view about the research efforts and directions. In this paper, the authors represent a bibliometric survey of the digital twin concept based on the Scopus database to present a global view about scholars' contributions in the manufacturing area. The study was conducted by retrieving 844 Scopus research papers published from 2015-2020 and analysed to find out critical insights such as publication volume, co-authorship networks, citation analysis, and demographic research distribution. The study revealed that significant contribution is made via concept propositions in conferences and some papers published in the journal. However, there is a scope of lots of research work in the direction of actual and secure digital twin implementation.",

      "Abstract": "The Internet of Things (loT) has paved the way for significant efficiency gains in the oil and gas industry. One concept that has garnered significant attention is the \"digital twin\". However, there remains a great deal of confusion surrounding what a digital twin actually is and how it can be harnessed to add value to oil and gas operations. Some use digital twin as a synonym for their 3D plant models, others for their predictive maintenance solutions, or their simulation models. The bottom line is that the digital twin is all of these and more and unless operators look at it holistically, they are likely to miss out on some of the benefits. Digital twins afford companies a number of advantages that would otherwise not be possible, including the ability to run risk analyses, health assessments, and what-if scenarios in real-time; the ability to train personnel in a 3D immersive, risk-free environment; and the capability to detect faults early before control limits are reached. This paper/ presentation will elaborate on how digital twins can be used to enhance efficiency and will address their use in the wider context of the oil and gas industry – with a particular focus on its impact on reducing risk and cost during both the project and operational phases of the asset lifecycle. The objective is to demystify the digital twin, outline the advanced capabilities it enables and illustrate how oil and gas operators can use this concept to improve their competitive advantage.",

      "Abstract": "The following chapter describes a concept model for proactive decision support system based on (real-time) predictive analytics and designed for maintenance of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in order to optimize its downtime. This concept later is referred to as proactive and predictive maintenance decision support systems or P2M for short. The concept is based on (i) the axioms of predictive decisions making, (ii) the proactive computing principles and (iii) models and methods for intelligent data processing. The aforementioned concept extends an idea of data-driven intelligent systems by using two approaches. The first approach implements predictive analytics, i.e. detection of a pre-failure event (called a proactive event) over a certain time period. This approach is based on the sequence of the following operational processes: to detect–to predict–to decide–to act. The second approach helps to automate maintenance decisions, which allows to exclude operational roles and move to supervisory level positions in the operational management structure. The concept includes the following primary components: ontology, a data warehouse (data lake), data factory as a set of data processing methods, flexible pipelines for data handling and processing and business processes with predictive decision logic for cyber-physical systems maintenance. This concept model is considered as the platform for the design of cyber-physical asset performance management systems.",

      "Abstract": "The predictive or proactive maintenance of complex systems and infrastructure requires the capability to centralise all of the relevant information and perform a comprehensive analysis to derive insights for timely decision-making. Cloud computing services enable the development of a repository and the integration of online monitoring and offline non-destructive inspection (NDI) data for health condition assessment. NDI signal processing and data analysis can thus migrate to Cloud as a Service (CaaS). In this paper, the development of NDI software for data analytics is briefly reviewed and a case study involving a cloud-based solution is presented, which is cost effective and easy to implement. Cloud-based NDI data analysis comprises three basic steps: (1) transferring NDI data to a database in the cloud; (2) performing data analysis; and (3) presenting and delivering the results. In the case study, the ultrasonic C-scan data are processed in the Microsoft Azure cloud. The features of the ultrasonic data, such as maximum magnitude and time-of-flight (TOF), can be extracted and presented through a web-based service. The solution can be easily deployed to tablets and smartphones for the end-users to access.",

      "Abstract": "In today’s competitive landscape, a growing number of enterprises are embarking on cyber-physical digitalization journeys to fulfil customer expectations and vitalize manufacturing processes in a cost-effective manner. Developing on top of Industry 4.0 paradigms, advanced robotics, predictive analytics, and process flow automation benefit from the use of digital replicas known as digital twins (DT). DT is a prevailing technology in manufacturing industries and leverages real-time monitoring, simulation, and decision-aid systems to generate feasible solutions to assist production operations, which can range from predictive maintenance to strategic planning. As a trending technology, many digital twin-driven approaches are formulated to achieve mass customization and implement smart product service systems. Hence, this chapter aims to provide insights into the various digital twin architectures and development trends in manufacturing environments. It also proposes the integration of other emerging technologies to allow stakeholders who are capitalizing on this technology to gain a significant competitive edge in the present competitive environment. With consideration to both business innovation and engineering product lifecycle management, this work serves as a guide to highlight the status of digital twin development trends and benefits with innovative use cases aiming at setting a consistent standard for digital twin creation throughout academia and industry.",

      "Title": "Proactive Learning for Intelligent Maintenance in Industry 4.0",
      "Abstract": "Manufacturing companies require efficient maintenance practices in order to improve business performance, ensure equipment availability and reduce process downtime. With the advent of new technology, manufacturing processes are evolving from the traditional ways into digitalized manufacturing. This transformation enables systems and machines to be connected in complex networks as a collaborative community through the industrial internet of things (IIoT) and cyber-physical system (CPS). Hence, advanced maintenance strategies should be developed in order to ensure the successful implementation of Industry 4.0, which aims to transform traditional product-oriented systems into product-service systems (PSS). Today, machines and systems are expected to gain self-awareness and self-predictiveness in order to provide management with more insight on the status of the factory. In this regards, real-time monitoring along with the application of advanced machine learning algorithms based on historical data will enable systems to understand the current operating conditions, predict the remaining useful life and detect anomalies in the process. This paper discusses the necessity of predictive maintenance to achieve a sustainable and service-oriented manufacturing system and provides a methodology to be followed for implementing proactive maintenance in the context of Industry 4.0.",

      "Abstract": "Real-time digital twins of ships in operation find many applications such as predictive maintenance, climbing the ladders of ship autonomy, and offshore operational excellence. The literature describes a focus on digital twinning of individual equipment such as navigation, propulsion, engine and power system, or crane. Yet, digital twinning and virtual prototyping for offshore operations are in their infancy and the onboard digitisation hardware and the telecommunication infrastructure are becoming accessible and affordable. Previous work has failed to address the need for building a holistic model and thus contextualising the equipment with the state of the whole vessel. A prototype of an online digital twin of a research vessel is proposed, its architecture described and its suitability for virtual prototyping demonstrated in a remote control centre. The study shows a viable proof of concept for remote monitoring and crew assistance in nominal and contingency response for offshore crane operations.",

      "Abstract": "Increasing trends in the digitalization of gas turbine plants allow significant opportunity for utilizing predictive maintenance methods to optimize engine performance. Digital twins have been used extensively to detect anomalies, prevent failures and encourage preventive maintenance activities. An active area of research is how to shift from preventative maintenance based on current conditions, to predictive maintenance based on future conditions. Close mapping of historical engine performance against air quality metrics and ambient weather conditions allow significant progress to be made towards true predictive maintenance, by providing a greater understanding of the condition of the turbine air inlet and compressor section. This allows for increasingly accurate predictions of future engine degradation due to air inlet pressure drop and compressor degradation to a fidelity useful for scheduling maintenance needs. An economic optimization can then be performed balancing the costs of the two engine degradation modes and the corrective actions that can be taken, namely air inlet pressure drop against filter replacement interval, and compressor degradation against compressor soak wash interval. This paper describes our experience in monitoring turbine performance to predict and optimize maintenance needs in combined cycle power plants.",

      "Title": "Digital twin models in industrial operations: A systematic literature review",
      "Abstract": "A Digital Twin is one of the enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 that couples actual physical systems with corresponding virtual representation. Currently, the application of Digital Twin models has attracted the attention of many researchers with the focus of production, predictive maintenance, and after-sale services. However, its role in industrial operations particularly in production, predictive maintenance, and after-sales services lacks efforts to systematically review the state-of-the-art. Moreover, this review discusses some of the challenges in implementing DT models to extend its role in the aforementioned application domains. In this paper, a systematic literature review was conducted to assess the role of Digital Twin models in industrial operations and to identify challenges for realization. Twenty-five research studies that were published until the end of June 2019 were selected and analyzed in order to show the current state-of-the-art on the role of Digital Twin models in the industrial operations and challenges in the implementation. Review results underline that the majority of the studies have focused on the application of Digital Twins in the production sector followed by predictive maintenance and after-sales services. Many authors have discussed how to apply Digital Twin models without remarking their role in the aforementioned domains of industrial operations. This paper provides insights for different industrial sectors, practitioners, researchers and experts of the field on the specific roles of Digital Twin models and challenges of implementing these models in the areas of production, predictive maintenance, and after-sale services.",

      "Abstract": "An Industrial IoT architecture is presented which enables edge computing of data collected from rotating machinery in a model conducive to multiple use cases. The architecture is compared to traditional \"IoT data to the cloud\" models and on-premise point solutions, illustrating the effectiveness of computing at the edge with a generic IoT solution. Customer benefits from the solution are presented and discussed. The initial solution framework of asset condition monitoring and predictive maintenance is provided by on-premise data analytics software incorporating historical models of asset behavior. Computer hardware traditionally available only in data centers is available to provide powerful computing capabilities. A wireless communications mesh is implemented to provide secure connectivity between plant assets, computers and workers. A digital twin is constructed and augmented reality methods are implemented to extract information from the raw data. Inclusion of plant personnel from planning, to installation, to implementation has been critical to the acceptance and use of the technology in operations. Implementation of a generic IoT architecture rather than a point solution increases the value obtained from the initial investment as subsequent solution frameworks are added. An IoT platform operating at the \"intelligent edge\" can be more efficient and less costly than cloud-based solutions, reducing time from acquired data to corrective action. An architecture which accounts for role-based and location-aware data presentation further increases the value of the data to the individual worker. Just bringing sensor data to an IoT cloud platform does not create business value from the data. Ensuring interoperability, connectivity, adherence to industry standards and integration of security and manageability are all prerequisites to architecting a scalable Industrial IoT solution that delivers value to the customer. Additional important benefits to the customer are safety, management of change and personal growth of the employees using the technology.",

      "Abstract": "Smart manufacturing (SM) is a term generally applied to the improvement in manufacturing operations through integration of systems, linking of physical and cyber capabilities, and taking advantage of information including leveraging the big data evolution. SM adoption has been occurring unevenly across industries, thus there is an opportunity to look to other industries to determine solution and roadmap paths for industries such as biochemistry or biology. The big data evolution affords an opportunity for managing significantly larger amounts of information and acting on it with analytics for improved diagnostics and prognostics. The analytics approaches can be defined in terms of dimensions to understand their requirements and capabilities, and to determine technology gaps. The semiconductor manufacturing industry has been taking advantage of the big data and analytics evolution by improving existing capabilities such as fault detection, and supporting new capabilities such as predictive maintenance. For most of these capabilities: (1) data quality is the most important big data factor in delivering high quality solutions; and (2) incorporating subject matter expertise in analytics is often required for realizing effective on-line manufacturing solutions. In the future, an improved big data environment incorporating smart manufacturing concepts such as digital twin will further enable analytics; however, it is anticipated that the need for incorporating subject matter expertise in solution design will remain.",

      "Abstract": "Airports are continuing to experience rising passenger numbers and increasing capacity constraints, as pressures on physical resources intensify.To cope with this, airport executives need to take a more systematic, methodical approach to digital transformation.They need to build on isolated deployments of innovative technology to move towards a more holistic vision.This paper explores this challenge and opportunity via the concept of the ‘real-time’ airport — a data-driven ecosystem, using real-time data to make better, more informed decisions, optimising operations.The paper aims to educate the reader on the four key components of the real-time airport: integrated planning, automated operations, digital twins and predictive maintenance. It outlines the steps needed to deliver in these areas and how, when combined, they can deliver the ability to significantly improve passenger experience and airport operations by reducing queues, pre-empting and minimising delays and improving the baggage-handling process.The real-time airport road map comprises six key elements, from single-point solutions and integrated systems through to solutions specific to airport domains, before moving on to airport-wide integration and even linking to the city through smart transport systems. Finally, the paper considers the need for collaboration within the industry to deliver on the promise of the real-time airport, to help ensure that airports are fit for future purposes in meeting the complex and continually evolving needs of air travellers.",

Those technologies include the digital twin, data analytics, and secure Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity. With these technologies, E&P operators can now better quantify the probabilities of untoward events and mitigate their risks, improving their HSE posture, and potentially reducing the cost of their insurance premiums.

Digital twinning of systems can be utilized for anomaly detection, diagnosis and the estimation of the system's remaining useful life in order to optimize operations and maintenance processes in a nuclear plant. In this regard, a conceptual framework for the application of digital twin technology for the prognosis of Control Element Drive Mechanism (CEDM), and a data-driven approach to anomaly detection using coil current profile are presented in this study. Health management of plant components can capitalize on the data and signals that are already recorded as part of the monitored parameters of the plant's instrumentation and control systems. This work is focused on the development of machine learning algorithm and workflow for the analysis of the CEDM using the recorded coil current data. The workflow involves features extraction from the coil-current profile and consequently performing both clustering and classification algorithms. This approach provides an opportunity for health monitoring in support of condition-based predictive maintenance optimization and in the development of the CEDM digital twin model for improved plant safety and availability.",

      "Abstract": "Digitalization transforms companies, businesses, and ecosystems in several ways. However, digital solutions have still often a supplementary role in company´s operations and the arising monetary benefits are typically hard to define. At the same time as digital technologies get more and more complex, so do the monetization models to create business value from these technologies. This paper focuses on establishing a framework to define the customer value generated by digital solutions and on examining the value creation potential of digital solutions. Firstly, the aim is in increasing understanding of phenomena of a customer value. Secondly, the customer value is researched empirically in case studies in maritime and in forest industry. The case studies focus on analyzing the technology providers’ digital solutions as risk mitigation investments where the cost-effectiveness is of central concern and where the benefits arise largely from the avoidance or reduction of negative consequences in the operation and maintenance phases of the asset life cycle. In the developed value assessment framework, the inherent uncertainty is taken into account by a what-if-analysis i.e. by re-calculating the results if initial parameter values are changed. The framework contributes to refining of the value of the digital solution, and to demonstrating and communicating the costs and risks as well as the benefits achieved by a potential customer.",

      "Title": "Prognostic Health Management of Production Systems. New Proposed Approach and Experimental Evidences",
      "Abstract": "Prognostic Health Management (PHM) is a maintenance policy aimed at predicting the occurrence of a failure in components and consequently minimizing unexpected downtimes of complex systems. Recent developments in condition monitoring (CM) techniques and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools enabled the collection of a huge amount of data in real-time and its transformation into meaningful information that will support the maintenance decision-making process. The emerging Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) technologies connect distributed physical systems with their virtual representations in the cyber computational world. The PHM assumes a key role in the implementation of CPS in manufacturing contexts, since it allows to keep CPS and its machines in proper conditions. On the other hand, CPS-based PHM provide an efficient solution to maximize availability of machines and production systems. In this paper, evolving and unsupervised approaches for the implementation of PHM at a component level are described, which are able to process streaming data in real-time and with almost-zero prior knowledge about the monitored component. A case study from a real industrial context is presented. Different unsupervised and online anomaly detection methods are combined with evolving clustering models in order to detect anomalous behaviours in streaming vibration data and integrate the so-generated knowledge into supervised and adaptive models; then, the degradation model for each identified fault is built and the resulting RUL prediction model integrated into the online analysis. Supervised methods are applied to the same dataset, in batch mode, to validate the proposed procedure.",

      "Abstract": "Predictive maintenance based on so-called digital twins is regarded as a central innovation in industry 4.0. It has been recognised as a key issue for the industry and is seen as a prerequisite for future success, since it can help to make the planning of maintenance measures and the associated decisions in the complex industrial environment more targeted and active. Intralogistics, which contributes significantly to the economic success of companies, is particularly required to anticipate the possibilities of digitization as soon as possible due to the strategic importance and the urgent need to ensure technical availability. This contribution takes up the existing approaches and methods of maintenance management and tries to link it with the possibilities and visions of industry 4.0, thereby creating a concept for integrated (holistic), knowledge-based maintenance in intralogistics.",

      "Abstract": "The economic use of machine tools is highly dependent on the material removal rate and the amount of machine downtime. As a result, manufacturing companies focus on increasing feed rates and cutting depths and on reducing the number of necessary maintenance measures. The digital twin enables the optimization of machining processes, while obeying the static and dynamic load limits, through a permanent data exchange between the real machine tool and its virtual representation. Additionally, the acquisition of data during the lifetime of machine tools allows to detect changes in the dynamic behaviour of the feed drive components. Variations of the determined modal parameters indicate changes in the wear condition. By means of a probabilistic classification its future progression can be forecasted.",

      "Title": "Machine learning and artificial intelligence as a complement to condition monitoring in a predictive maintenance setting",
      "Abstract": "In recent years, the oil and gas industry has gained greater operational efficiencies and productivity by deploying advanced technologies, such as smart sensors, data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning — all linked via Internet of Things connectivity. This transformation is profound, but just starting. Leading offshore E&P operators envision using such applications to help drive their production costs to as low as $7 per barrel or less. A large North Sea operator among them successfully deployed a low-manned platform in the Ivar Aasen field in December 2016, operating it via redundant control rooms — one on the platform, the other onshore 1,000 kilometers away in Trondheim, Norway. In January 2019, the offshore control room operators handed over the platform's control to the onshore operators, and it is now managed exclusively from the onshore one. One particular application — remote condition monitoring of equipment — supports a proactive, more predictive condition-based maintenance program, which is helping to ensure equipment availability, maximize utilization, and find ways to improve performance. This paper will explain the use case in greater detail, including insights into how artificial intelligence and machine learning are incorporated into this operational model. Also described will be the application of a closed-loop lifecycle platform management model, using the concepts of digital twins from pre-FEED and FEED phases through construction, commissioning, and an expected lifecycle spanning 20 years of operations. It is derived from an update to a paper presented at the 2018 SPE Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) that introduced the use case in its 2017-18 operating model, but that was before the debut of the platform's exclusive monitoring of its operations by its onshore control room.",

      "Title": "Innovation insight for healthcare provider digital twins: A review",
      "Abstract": "Digital twins are evolving into a required next-generation capability for healthcare process simulation modeling. As healthcare delivery organizations gear for digital transformation, IT must meet the increased demands to deliver accurate digital twins assistance in reducing human intervention in almost every domain. In simple terms, a digital twin is a virtual copy of a tangible entity (such as vehicle engines or people) or an intangible system (like manufacturing processes or marketing systems) that can be analyzed independently of its real-world counterpart in order to make informed decisions. NASA employed a similar concept. It had physical replicas of its spacecrafts on Earth while the actual ones were in outer space. This proved crucial in the Apollo 13 mission where engineers on Earth could determine the issue and find a solution with the same assets as the astronauts. Such undertakings eventually gave way to fully digital simulations applied in various sectors. Siemens, the German engineering giant, has employed such a twin for its Amberg factory, which produces industrial computer-control systems. \"This digital twin is identical in every respect and is used to design the control units, test them, simulate how to make them and program production machines. Once everything is humming along nicely, the digital twin hands over to the physical factory to begin making things for real,\" writes The Economist. With the increasing prevalence in the use of wearables, social media, smart living, and personalized recommender systems for consumer health, it becomes imperative to converge these technologies to provide personalized, context driven, proactive, and preventive care in real time. Digital Twins are a convergence technology and involve making a digital replica of any living or nonliving entity. At present, Digital Twins are extensively used in Industry 4.0 where Digital Twins help in optimizing the performance of machines by proactive and predictive maintenance. This chapter gives an overview of the existing literature and aims to provide an overview of existing literature on Digital Twins for personal health and well-being-key terminologies, key applications, and key gaps.",

      "Abstract": "In order to design, operate, and maintain an oil and gas facility, one must first understand its behavior. A model-driven engineering and operation solution is required to analyze and identify problems early on and then improve design to ensure further problems are less likely.Predictive models are already shaping our experiences. They recommend products and services based on our habits. Predictive models of electrical power networks serve as a 'digital twin' of the system including network topology, engineering parameters, and other pertinent information with real-time data acquired for depicting the actual operation of the system.A clear and thorough understanding of the operational system increases uptime and reduces the number of unnecessary shutdowns. Predictive simulation models help engineers and operators increase their understanding of systems in a cost-effective and repeatable environment by offering Situational Intelligence & Automation.This paper will include the benefits of adding such a system, the challenges that must be overcome and the lessons that have been learned from the implementation of several of these systems. It will also serve as a handbook on justification for a model-driven power management and automation of oil and gas facilities.",

The failure prediction of the functional part is helpful to prepare the maintenance scheme in time, in order to ensure a stable manufacturing process and the required production quality. Due to the rise of digital twin (DT), which has the characteristics of virtual reality interaction and real-time mapping, a DT-based real-time prediction method of the remaining useful life (RUL) and preventive maintenance scheme is proposed in this study. In this method, a DT model of the manufacturing workshop is established based on real-time perceptual information obtained by the proposed acquisition method. Subsequently, the real-time RUL of the functional part is predicted by establishing an RUL prediction model based on the nonlinear-drifted Brownian motion, which takes the working conditions and measurement errors into consideration. On this basis, the optimal preventive maintenance scheme can be determined and fed back to the manufacturing workshop, in order to guide the maintenance of relevant parts. Finally, an example case study is presented to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "Title": "Digital twin: Origin to future",
      "Abstract": "Digital Twin (DT) refers to the virtual copy or model of any physical entity (physical twin) both of which are interconnected via exchange of data in real time. Conceptually, a DT mimics the state of its physical twin in real time and vice versa. Application of DT includes real-time monitoring, designing/planning, optimization, maintenance, remote access, etc. Its implementation is expected to grow exponentially in the coming decades. The advent of Industry 4.0 has brought complex industrial systems that are more autonomous, smart, and highly interconnected. These systems generate considerable amounts of data useful for several applications such as improving performance, predictive maintenance, training, etc. A sudden influx in the number of publications related to ‘Digital Twin’ has led to confusion between different terminologies related to the digitalization of industries. Another problem that has arisen due to the growing popularity of DT is a lack of consensus on the description of DT as well as so many different types of DT, which adds to the confusion. This paper intends to consolidate the different types of DT and different definitions of DT throughout the literature for easy identification of DT from the rest of the complimentary terms such as ‘product avatar’, ‘digital thread’, ‘digital model’, and ‘digital shadow’. The paper looks at the concept of DT since its inception to its predicted future to realize the value it can bring to certain sectors. Understanding the characteristics and types of DT while weighing its pros and cons is essential for any researcher, business, or sector before investing in the technology.",

      "Title": "The digital shopfloor: Industrial automation in the industry 4.0 era: Performance analysis and applications",
      "Abstract": "In today’s competitive global environment, manufacturers are offered with unprecedented opportunities to build hyper-efficient and highly flexible plants, towards meeting variable market demand, while at the same time supporting new production models such as make-to-order (MTO), configure-to-order (CTO) and engineer-to-order (ETO). During the last couple of years, the digital transformation of industrial processes is propelled by the emergence and rise of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). The latter is based on the extensive deployment of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies in the manufacturing shopfloor, as well as on the seamless and timely exchange of digital information across supply chain participants. The benefits of Industry 4.0 have been already proven in the scope of pilot and production deployments in a number of different use cases including flexibility in automation, predictive maintenance, zero defect manufacturing and more. Despite early implementations and proof-of-concepts, CPPS/IIoT deployments are still in their infancy for a number of reasons, including: Manufacturers’ poor awareness about digital manufacturing solutions and their business value potential, as well as the lack of relevant internal CPPS/IIoT knowledge. The high costs that are associated with the deployment, maintenance and operation of CPPS systems in the manufacturing shopfloors, which are particularly challenging in the case of SME (Small Medium Enterprises) manufacturers that lack the equity capital needed to invest in Industry 4.0. The time needed to implement CPPS/IIoT and the lack of a smooth and proven migration path from existing OT solutions. The uncertainty over the business benefits and impacts of IIoT and CPPS technologies, including the lack of proven methods for the techno-economic evaluation of Industry 4.0 systems. Manufacturers’ increased reliance on external integrators, consultants and vendors. The absence of a well-developed value chain needed to sustain the acceptance of these new technologies for digital automation. In order to alleviate these challenges, three European Commission funded projects (namely H2020 FAR-EDGE (http://www.far-edge.eu/), H2020 DAEDALUS (http://daedalus.iec61499.eu) and H2020 AUTOWARE (http://www.autoware-eu.org/)) have recently joined forces towards a “Digital Shopfloor Alliance”. The Alliance aims at providing leading edge and standards based digital automation solutions, along with guidelines and blueprints for their effective deployment, validation and evaluation. The present book provides a comprehensive description of some of the most representative solutions that offered by these three projects, along with the ways these solutions can be combined in order to achieve multiplier effects and maximize the benefits of their use. The presented solutions include standards-based digital automation solutions, following different deployment paradigms, such as cloud and edge computing systems. Moreover, they also comprise a rich set of digital simulation solutions, which are explored in conjunction with the H2020 MAYA project (http://www.maya-euproject.com/). The latter facilitate the testing and evaluation of what-if scenarios at low risk and cost, but also without disrupting shopfloor operations. As already outlined, beyond leading edge scientific and technological development solutions, the book comprises a rich set of complementary assets that are indispensable to the successful adoption of IIoT/CPPS in the shopfloor. The book is structured in three parts as follows: The first part of the book is devoted to digital automation platforms. Following an introduction to Industry 4.0 in general and digital automation platforms in particular, this part presents the digital automation platforms of the FAR-EDGE, AUTOWARE and DAEDALUS projects. The second part of the book focuses on the presentation of digital simulation and digital twins’ functionalities. These include information about the models that underpin digital twins, as well as the simulators that enable experimentation with these processes over these digital models. The third part of the book provides information about complementary assets and supporting services that boost the adoption of digital automation functionalities in the Industry 4.0 era. Training services, migration services and ecosystem building services are discussed based on the results of the three projects of the Digital Shopfloor Alliance. The target audience of the book includes: Researchers in the areas of Digital Manufacturing and more specifically in the areas of digital automation and simulation, who wish to be updated about latest Industry 4.0 developments in these areas. Manufacturers, with an interest in the next generation of digital automation solutions based on Cyber-Physical systems.",

      "Abstract": "A semi-analytical digital twin model of a 90 kW.h li-ion battery pack was developed to capture thermal behavior of the pack in a real-time environment. The solution uses reducedorder models that minimize compute cost/time yet are accurate in predicting real-world operation. The real-time heat generation rate in the battery pack is calculated using 2RC equivalent circuit model. A series of HPPC tests were conducted to calibrate the equivalent circuit model in order to accurately calculate heat generation rate as a function of SOC, temperature, current, charge/discharge mode and pulse duration. In the paper, live-sensor data was integrated into the digital twin system level model of the battery pack to create a real-time environment. The generated tool was utilized to monitor the real-time temperature of the battery pack remotely and have a predictive maintenance solution. The model results for heat generation rate, terminal voltage, and temperature were found to be consistent with the test data across a wide range of conditions. The generated model was used to accelerate battery pack design and development by enabling the evaluation of design feasibility and to conduct in-depth root causes analyses for various inputs and operating conditions, including initial SOC, temperature, coolant flow rate, different charge and discharge profiles. The resulting digital twin model provides additional data that cannot be measured offering the EV industry an opportunity to improve its safety record.",

      "Title": "Digital twin through the life of a field",
      "Abstract": "The global energy industry is being radically transformed by increased access to data and digitalization of tools and processes. When data is harnessed effectively and then combined with engineering insight it has the ability to radically improve how energy assets are designed, operated and optimized from concept and front end design all the way through the life of the field to decommissioning. Aker Solutions has developed a data platform and series of software applications which together form a digital twin capable of optimizing energy operations at a product, facility and field level integrating subsea and topside facilities. The digital twin, conceived during the early concept phase (or retrofit to existing assets), draws together diverse data sources into an integrated format which can be managed and enriched as the asset progresses through its lifecycle. Software applications built on this platform include: • Using knowledge-based and adaptable building blocks, our early phase software application accelerates the development of concepts with the ability to rapidly explore different options and adjust and optimize to different customer driven variables • During detailed design phase, software applications are used to drive engineering automation and ensure that safety is built inherently into the design • Simulation software applications are used to test and evaluate complex installation operations in a virtual environment before any offshore operations take place • Digital twin can add significant value during operations and maintenance activities with performance and integrity data collated and visualized helping to make informed decisions to ensure production optimization and continuity • At a product level, Aker Solutions' connected subsea equipment uses software applications and analytics to perform condition monitoring and enable predictive maintenance, maximizing production uptime This digital thread allows data to seamlessly transition across asset phases enabling engineers, operators and asset managers to make informed and confident data-driven decisions; increasing efficiency, reducing cost and reducing risk.",

      "Title": "REPLICA: A solution for next generation iot and digital twin based fault diagnosis and predictive maintenance",
      "Abstract": "Nowadays competitiveness goes through several aspects: digitalization, productivity and environmental impact. Technology is advancing fast and helping industries to obtain more and more detailed data about their processes and equipment. In fact, the possibility to monitor and control each part of the process is a strong base on which a more intelligent and focused control can be built. Technology advance brings innovation and the possibility to manage the production in terms of”near future” through AI prediction and decision-making support. Forecasting demands and planning production, optimizing process by reducing costs and improving efficiency without corrupting the quality of the product is a big challenge at the plant level. In this paper, a flexible, scalable architecture for intelligent digital twin realization called REPLICA has been proposed to cope with such problem and help industries to advance and discover possible optimizations. This architecture sits on top of two European projects, namely CPSwarm and RECLAIM, where their contribution focus on distributed simulation and optimization, and Adaptive Sensorial Networks, correspondingly. As a validation process, a hypothetical use case is presented, detailing the key differentiating points and benefits of the proposed architecture.",

      "Title": "Predictive Maintenance Model of Refined Aircraft Tires Replacement",
      "Abstract": "Development of new predictive maintenance models in aviation relies on traditional maintenance programs that cost-effectively ensure flight safety. Design individually oriented predictive maintenance programs for each group of units according to the specificity of systems, assemblies and structural elements of modern aircraft requires considering data of behaviour during aircraft operational life cycle (aircraft digital twin). This article describes the current practical approach and proposes a model of predictive maintenance together with airline warehouse stock optimization system and Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) organization capacity management with particular focus on tires. Analysis of parameters that can potentially affect aircraft nose wheel tires wear and selection of the most relevant factors to build a model for tire replacement forecast using flight data recorders are described in this study. The resulting model is used for the creation of automated production load management system for MRO organization facilities considering their ultimate capacity. The model determines optimal stock or buffer needed for wheel replacement and continuous aircraft fleet operation. The model gives the possibility to calculate the minimum necessary number of spare wheels in the warehouse to ensure continuous operation of a given number of aircraft and a given MRO capacity. As a result of this, I present the Analysis of method’s economic efficiency and evaluate losses associated with early wheel removal and spare wheels capacity.",

      "Title": "Modular Fault Ascription and Corrective Maintenance Using a Digital Twin",
      "Abstract": "The industrial environment is slowly transforming to a networked system of systems nature with industry 4.0. Automation systems are getting more production friendly by being more reconfigurable and adaptable. The plant engineering process is also getting improved by offering modular architecture, model-based engineering, etc. This transformation necessitates novel methodologies in maintenance practices as well. With the emergence of predictive maintenance techniques, sometimes it is possible to predict a breakdown and thus conveniently schedule the corrective maintenance. But this is not always the case, the incidence of unscheduled corrective maintenance is prevalent in an industrial environment. And the methodologies for corrective maintenance have to be reshaped fitting to the new plant environment. This paper introduces a new modular corrective maintenance methodology, using the digital twin of an automation module. Fault ascription support for a human technician, performing corrective maintenance action of an automation module is provided by its digital twin and associated visual interface. A use case scenario is propounded and future visions are presented.",

      "Title": "Future maintenance: Transitioning from digitalisation to industry 4.0",
      "Abstract": "Increasing digitization offers the potential to further improve predictive maintenance through condition monitoring, ensuring maintenance is only undertaken when it is genuinely needed. Offering a more intelligent approach to the maintenance regime, using prevention rather than cure, therefore, results in real time and cost benefits that are deliverable now. Increased automation at Festo's factory has enhanced the role of maintenance and led to a greater emphasis on sharing knowledge. The Scharnhausen Technology Plant is Festo's main production facility for valves, valve terminals, and control electronics, covering 66,000m2 of space arranged over four levelsand housing a workforce of around 1200 people. To create the Industry 4.0 environment, Festo has either piggy backed intelligence onto existing machines or embedded it in new equipment. The plant uses Near Field Communications (NFC) for digital maintenance support. This means that equipment components can exchange data directly with the maintenance team without passing through a central database. For the maintenance team, this presents new ways to interact with the factory equipment and gather useful data. Their main tool is a tablet with a mobile depth sensor, enables the user to acess more information the closer they are to the components requiring attention. At the high level the tablet may show an ovreview graphic of the entire plant layout and indicate that there is an alert raised on a machine on a production line. For less serious events, information about the reasons for the alert can be interrogated remotely without any need to interrupt production. Augmented reality is another exciting area under development. The concept of a Digital Twin - a CAD generated model that enables designers to simulate how a machine will function, is already possible.",

      "Abstract": "The introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the construction industry is evolving facility maintenance (FM) towards predictive maintenance development. Predictive maintenance of building facilities requires continuously updated data on construction components to be acquired through integrated sensors. The main challenges in developing predictive maintenance tools for building facilities is IoT integration, IoT data visualization on the building 3D model and implementation of maintenance management system on the IoT and building information modeling (BIM). The current 3D building models do not fully interact with IoT building facilities data. Data integration in BIM is challenging. The research aims to integrate IoT alert systems with BIM models to moni-tor building facilities during the operational phase and to visualize building facilities’ conditions virtually. To provide efficient maintenance services for building facilities this research proposes an integration of a digital framework based on IoT and BIM platforms. Sensors applied in the building systems and IoT technology on a cloud platform with opensource tools and standards enable monitoring of real-time operation and detecting of different kinds of faults in case of malfunction or failure, therefore sending alerts to facility managers and operators. Proposed preventive maintenance methodology applied on a proof-of-concept heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) plant adopts open source IoT sensor networks. The results show that the integrated IoT and BIM dashboard framework and implemented building structures preventive maintenance methodology are applicable and promising. The automated system architecture of building facilities is intended to provide a reliable and practical tool for real-time data acquisition. Analysis and 3D visualization to support intelligent monitoring of the indoor condition in buildings will enable the facility managers to make faster and better decisions and to improve building facilities’ real time monitoring with fallouts on the maintenance timeliness.",

      "Title": "Approach for a holistic predictive maintenance strategy by incorporating a digital twin",
      "Abstract": "Determination of the right time for machine maintenance is a major challenge for many industrial companies. Currently, most companies react on occurring breakdowns (reactive maintenance) or maintenance is carried out in scheduled time intervals (preventive maintenance). These results in either unexpected production stops, or a waste of machine working hours, because components are switched too early. Consequently, predictive maintenance strategies offer a big potential. An essential part of predictive maintenance is the estimation of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of machine assets. RUL estimation approaches are based on statistical methods and derived algorithms. Thus, a lot of data is needed for a good estimation. Additionally, data can be generated by means of simulation to improve the RUL estimation. However, companies hardly have an overview of available data and according modules, which are needed for a holistic predictive maintenance strategy. This paper shows an approach for a predictive maintenance strategy dealing with acquisition, processing, and analysis of historical field data as well as the generation of respective simulation data. A structured process map with a derived systematic strategy will give companies an idea of how they can integrate predictive maintenance into existing processes. By incorporating the concept of a digital twin of a production machine, the interaction of measured and estimated as well as generated data by means of simulation, are shown. The digital twin could deliver results to retrofit data-driven prediction models, in order to improve the estimation of the RUL.",

      "Title": "How to tell the difference between a model and a digital twin",
      "Abstract": "“When I use a word, it means whatever I want it to mean”: Humpty Dumpty in Alice’s Adventures Through The Looking Glass, Lewis Carroll. “Digital twin” is currently a term applied in a wide variety of ways. Some differences are variations from sector to sector, but definitions within a sector can also vary significantly. Within engineering, claims are made regarding the benefits of using digital twinning for design, optimisation, process control, virtual testing, predictive maintenance, and lifetime estimation. In many of its usages, the distinction between a model and a digital twin is not made clear. The danger of this variety and vagueness is that a poor or inconsistent definition and explanation of a digital twin may lead people to reject it as just hype, so that once the hype and the inevitable backlash are over the final level of interest and use (the “plateau of productivity”) may fall well below the maximum potential of the technology. The basic components of a digital twin (essentially a model and some data) are generally comparatively mature and well-understood. Many of the aspects of using data in models are similarly well-understood, from long experience in model validation and verification and from development of boundary, initial and loading conditions from measured values. However, many interesting open questions exist, some connected with the volume and speed of data, some connected with reliability and uncertainty, and some to do with dynamic model updating. In this paper we highlight the essential differences between a model and a digital twin, outline some of the key benefits of using digital twins, and suggest directions for further research to fully exploit the potential of the approach.",

      "Abstract": "In the current serial technological process of fully mechanized roadway, the low mechanical intelligence degree of the equipment and the serious imbalance of mining and drivage have become the main technical bottlenecks in the efficient production of coal mine. Firstly, based on the technology concept of the combination of automatic driving mode and self-moving support of the integrated driving and anchoring unit, a new parallel technology system is presented based on the combination of excavation, support and anchor in fully mechanized roadway followed with its process principle and advantages of the parallel construction technology in engineering benefits. Then a parallel construction technical process and technological system of the fully mechanized roadway is constructed under the guidance of the digital twin theory based on the robotized upgrade and reconstruction goal of the parallel process technology equipment of the fully mechanized roadway. It is a preliminary discussion on the intelligent development of parallel process technology and equipment, which aims to build an intelligent parallel operation mode including many functions such as the remote visualization guidance of the tunneling robot, the reliable support of the temporary support robot, and the multi-station anchor of the drilling and anchoring robot in a fully mechanized roadway. In the parallel construction technology system driven by the digital twin technology, multi-source sensing information's linking and mutual translation are used to realize the interactive perception between the physical entities of parallel process technology equipment and the model of virtual digital twin. Meanwhile, the intelligent innovations of roadheader, such as autonomous deviation correction, obstacle sensing and automatic cutting, have been completed through the intelligent control system. Finally, the key technology development of an intelligent fully mechanized face under the guidance of digital twin theory is analyzed from four aspects including real physical topological relations, data transmission and fusion method, intelligent decision control algorithm and predictive maintenance mechanism, which means some preliminary works for the target of intelligent coal mine and intelligent mining.",

      "Abstract": "The transformation of the common production plant to a cyber-physical system is one of the most recent developments in manufacturing industry. The analysis of data streams produced by such sensor-equipped plants promises potential for process optimization. However, for competitive reasons and due to the novelty of the development, the access to publicly available real-world data is quite limited. Hence, businesses and researchers new to this area are often confronted with the cumbersome and complex task of synthesizing time series in order to gain first experiences. This work presents a novel concept and a corresponding software implementation for the stream-wise generation and publication of sensor data, to simulate condition monitoring of industrial production plants. The resulting configuration file-driven tool is capable of acting like a sensor-equipped plant by generating data points from various Gaussian Process-based models and mathematical expressions, or by replaying data sets. Moreover, it can be seamlessly connected with existing surrounding systems by using the MQTT protocol. In this context, the software aims at laying the foundation for real-world applications and improving them by providing a simulation tool to prototype and test with.",

      "Title": "Structural Health Monitoring and Prognostic of Industrial Plants and Civil Structures: A Sensor to Cloud Architecture",
      "Abstract": "The deployment of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems is a natively interdisciplinary task that involves joint research contributions from sensing technologies, data science and civil engineering. The capability to assess, also from remote stations, the working conditions of industrial plants or the structural integrity of civil buildings is widely requested in many application fields. The technological development aims to continuously provide innovative tools and approaches to satisfy these demands. As a first instance, reliable monitoring strategies are needed to detect structural damages while filtering out environmental noise. Ongoing solutions to tackle these topics are based on the exploitation of highly customized sensing technologies, such as shaped transducers for Acoustic Emission (AE) testing or Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) accelerometers for Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) [1]. On the other hand, effective data acquisition and storage techniques must be employed to cope with the heterogeneity of the sensing devices and with the amount of data produced by collecting raw measured signals. Finally, damage detection and prediction tasks should be computed via data-driven algorithms that can complement the model-based alternatives traditionally used in civil engineering. Layered SHM architectures [2] represent straightforward approaches to address the system complexity originated by this interdisciplinary design; however, few real-world implementations have been presented so far in the literature. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by presenting an Internet of Things (IoT)-based SHM architecture for the predictive maintenance of industrial sites and civil engineering structures and infrastructures. The proposed cyber-physical system includes a monitoring layer, that consists of accelerometer-based sensor networks, a data acquisition layer, built on the recent W3C Web of Things standard [3], and a data storage and analytics layer, which leverages distributed database and Machine Learning tools. We extensively discuss the hardware/software components of the proposed SHM architecture, by stressing its advantages in terms of device versatility, data scalability and interoperability support. Finally, the effectiveness of the system is validated on a real-world use-case, i.e., the monitoring of a metallic frame structure located at the SHM research labs of the University of Bologna, Italy, within the MAC4PRO project [4].",

      "Abstract": "Digital twin technology can provide significant value for the prognostics and health management (PHM) of critical plant components by improving insight into system design and operating conditions. Digital twinning of systems can be utilized for anomaly detection, diagnosis and the estimation of the system's remaining useful life in order to optimize operations and maintenance processes in a nuclear plant. In this regard, a conceptual framework for the application of digital twin technology for the prognosis of Control Element Drive Mechanism (CEDM), and a data-driven approach to anomaly detection using coil current profile are presented in this study. Health management of plant components can capitalize on the data and signals that are already recorded as part of the monitored parameters of the plant's instrumentation and control systems. This work is focused on the development of machine learning algorithm and workflow for the analysis of the CEDM using the recorded coil current data. The workflow involves features extraction from the coil-current profile and consequently performing both clustering and classification algorithms. This approach provides an opportunity for health monitoring in support of condition-based predictive maintenance optimization and in the development of the CEDM digital twin model for improved plant safety and availability.",

      "Abstract": "Predictive maintenance in a manufacturing company is strategic, in order to maintain high production quality and to avoid unexpected production downtimes. In this scenario, the prediction of future machineries health status is necessary in order to plan maintenance cycles and to optimize the production. The proposed approach relies on the use of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) techniques mapped from the electronic domain to the production line domain. This paper proposes a general framework based on the EDA approach that allows to set-up a maintenance strategy by analyzing data retrieved from sensors. An MSM, is associated to each observable measurement, while a Supervisor monitors the current state of each Monitoring State Machine (MSM) by raising alerts when the monitored equipment is deviating from its normal behavior. This framework is the Digital-Twin of the plant devoted to its monitoring. It has some execution modalities ranging from online monitoring to predictive maintenance. The methodology has been applied to a mechanical transmission system showing its effectiveness.",

      "Abstract": "Modern aerospace industry is migrating from reactive to proactive and predictive maintenance to increase platform operational availability and efficiency, extend its useful life cycle and reduce its life cycle cost. Multiphysics modeling together with data-driven analytics generate a new paradigm called \"Digital Twin.\" The digital twin is actually a living model of the physical asset or system, which continually adapts to operational changes based on the collected online data and information, and can forecast the future of the corresponding physical counterpart. This paper reviews the overall framework to develop a digital twin coupled with the industrial Internet of Things technology to advance aerospace platforms autonomy. Data fusion techniques particularly play a significant role in the digital twin framework. The flow of information from raw data to high-level decision making is propelled by sensor-to-sensor, sensor-to-model, and model-to-model fusion. This paper further discusses and identifies the role of data fusion in the digital twin framework for aircraft predictive maintenance.",

      "Abstract": "In Smart Manufacturing, the Internet of Things technology brings about new possibilities as for the interaction of Cyber-Physical Systems with their virtual models- in Industry 4.0 jargon, Digital Twins. Besides traditional roles in engineering and control design, Digital Twins cab play innovative ones by evolving together with their cyber-physical counterpart: predictive maintenance, fault detection, or fast training of data-based decision aid tools. In this paper we focus on the relevance of dynamic models in this scenario, particularly as for the co-existence of continuous-time and discrete-event models wherever control and planning are involved. We argue that in such cases, models with analysis-specific levels of detail have to co-exist, interact and maintain mutual consistency. We propose a modelling approach to address the problem, and present a supporting example based on an object-oriented modelling language.",

      "Title": "Small business awareness and adoption of state-of-the-art technologies in emerging and developing markets, and lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic",
      "Abstract": "Many challenges continue to hinder digital technologies' adoption by small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) in developing economies. Comparatively, there are more success stories by SMEs in emerging markets. However, most SMEs operating in the informal sector in the emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) face similar challenges that inhibit the adoption of advanced technologies and innovations needed to improve business operations and re-engineer processes. This article evaluates the implementation and use of state-of-the-art technologies by SMEs in EMDEs to improve operations performance and create sustainable competitive advantages. Further, the papers in this Special Issue identify FinTech and analytical algorithms as some of the current technologies employed by SMEs in EMDEs to improve operations and processes in the manufacturing and service industries. The recognized technologies and technical innovations that seem novel in EMDEs have long existed in the advanced economies. Most state-of-the-art technologies, including cloud computing, 'big data', and predictive analytics that can improve operations and strategic decisions, are yet to make inroads in most EMDEs. Also, disruptive computing technologies, data analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) required to engineer new business models, reduce overheads, enhance competitive advantages, and digitize SMEs' business operations remain untapped. The absence and non-adoption of digital technologies in EMDEs explain why business activities in most EMDEs remain shut during the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and the community lockdown to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. The strategies to survive the 'new normal' imposed by COVID-19 and fierce global competition includes a successful adoption of advanced technologies.",

      "Abstract": "Cyber-physical production systems (CPPS), as an emerging Industry 4.0’s technology, trigger a paradigm shift from descriptive to prescriptive maintenance. In particular, maintenance management approaches nowadays are more and more transformed to (semi-) automated knowledge-based decision support systems. This paper is intended to examine existing approaches and challenges towards rethinking maintenance in the context of Industry 4.0 and thus contributes to the literature of production management and planning, by introducing a novel prescriptive maintenance model (PriMa). PriMa is comprising of four layers (i.e. data management, predictive data analytic toolbox, recommender and decision support dashboard as well as an overarching layer for semantic-based learning and reasoning). The integrated approach of PriMa enhances two functional capabilities, namely i) efficiently processing large amount of multi-modal and heterogeneous data collected from multidimensional data sources and ii) effectively generating decision support measures and recommendations for improving and optimising forthcoming maintenance plans correlated with production planning and control (PPC) systems. An industry-oriented proof-of-concept study has been conducted to explore the feasibility of applying PriMa in real production systems by implementing a decision support solution and achieving a significant reduction of downtime. Finally, future research directions in this area are outlined.",

      "Abstract": "Additive Manufacturing (AM) is currently seen as an interesting process for the fabrication of complex and high value-added functional products. AM is being increasingly used in manufacturing bringing forward technological advancements particularly in materials and process optimisations. Simultaneously, the lifecycle of manufactured products is increasingly based on an ‘all-digital’ context using cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 devices. This has led to huge amounts of digital data being generated in manufacturing projects development. Data management is one of the key issues for diffusing and adopting this technology. However, the commonly used digital thread for AM is based on old solutions, such as STL and G-code, which were developed during the 1980s and are not well synchronised with current advanced developments in AM. Moreover, digital thread needs to be contextualised according to the complexities of the sector in which it is being used. Hence, alternative formats should also take into account global and sectorial application. This paper presents the past and current research for a state-of-the-art data model digital thread, as well as perspectives and recommendations for a performing data model thread adapted to the different needs of the AM community.",

      "Abstract": "Industry 4.0, smart manufacturing and its related technologies are now becoming the leading trend in the development of the manufacturing industry. One of the key drivers of Industry 4.0 is big data analytics, which can transform large amounts of data into useful information, enabling astute and rapid decision-making strategies when combined with expert domain knowledge. The semiconductor industry is the most important high-tech industry in Taiwan, but it is also one of the most energy-consuming industries in the country. Therefore, it is critical to improve the efficiency of the manufacturing process and reduce the overall energy consumption of facility systems. This research demonstrates how to apply big data analytics in the semiconductor industry to explore the relationships of various machine parameters, develop predictive models for machine energy efficiency and apply optimisation tools to minimise energy consumption, while meeting the production demands. An empirical study is conducted in conjunction with a semiconductor corporation in Taiwan, targeting the air compressor system in its factory. The research framework is shown to be capable of assisting semiconductor fabrication plant decision-makers in optimising machine configurations, resulting in more than 10% savings on energy consumption and significantly decreased manufacturing costs.",

      "Abstract": "A cyber-physical system (CPS) is a new trend in smart manufacturing-related research, where the physical system acts as a data access role with sensors and communication systems to collect real-world information and communicate to computation modules (i.e. cyber layer), which further analyse and notify the findings to the corresponding physical systems through multiple feedback loops. This paper develops a conceptual framework for a new paradigm called smart factory based on CPS by applying virtual-real mapping and fusion, digital twin, big data-driven, virtualisation, and edge-to-cloud service technology to the manufacturing system. The definitions, characteristics, architectures and previous case studies on smart factory based on CPS are explained in detail. In the paradigm, the digital twin merges the physical system modelling and cyberspace simulation to provide an intelligence solution simulation analysis ability. This generates a variety of digital designs of production processes, quality, cost, efficiency and environmental impact analysis about smart factory business mode in the preproduction phase based on big data which can be analysed, and provide authoritative solutions for actual physical space. The proposed system is applied and validated in a real case study from the circuit breaker production industry.",

It is clear that challenging, complex and combinatory or ‘crossover’ knowledge issues arise periodically as competing system processes rise and fall in popularity with rivalrous automakers. This involves achieving the image if not the reality as ‘digital twins’ of prescience in marketing, monitoring and maintenance. These are all central elements of ‘surveillance capitalism’ facilitated by big data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Such combinations are envisioned and to varying degrees implemented in what Industry 4.0 advocates call the ‘smart factory’, but its critics call the ‘lights out’ or ‘dark factory’. This is because of its potentially full automation and absence of humans. Brief conclusions follow.",

      "Title": "Physical, data-driven and hybrid approaches to model engine exhaust gas temperatures in operational conditions",
      "Abstract": "Fast diesel engine models for real-time prediction in dynamic conditions are required to predict engine performance parameters, to identify emerging failures early on and to establish trends in performance reduction. In order to address these issues, two main alternatives exist: one is to exploit the physical knowledge of the problem, the other one is to exploit the historical data produced by the modern automation system. Unfortunately, the first approach often results in hard-to-tune and very computationally demanding models that are not suited for real-time prediction, while the second approach is often not trusted because of its questionable physical grounds. In this paper, the authors propose a novel hybrid model, which combines physical and data-driven models, to model diesel engine exhaust gas temperatures in operational conditions. Thanks to the combination of these two techniques, the authors were able to build a fast, accurate and physically grounded model that bridges the gap between the physical and data driven approaches. In order to support the proposal, the authors will show the performance of the different methods on real-world data collected from the Holland Class Oceangoing Patrol Vessel.",

Open source technology can comprise of software, hardware and hybrid solutions that nowadays drive Smart Manufacturing. The major potential of open source technology in Smart Manufacturing lies in enabling interoperability and in reducing the capital costs of designing and implementing new manufacturing solutions. After presenting our motivation to adopt an open source approach for the design of a DT demonstrator, we identify the major implementation requirements of Smart Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) and DTs. A conceptualisation of the core components of a DT demonstrator is provided and three technology building blocks for the realisation of a DT have been identified. These technology building blocks include components for the management of data, models and services. From the conceptual model of the DT demonstrator, we derived a high-level micro-services architecture and provided a case study infrastructure for the implementation of the DT demonstrator based on available open source technologies. The paper closes with research questions to be addressed in the future.",

The paper presents both the software and hardware architecture of an Edge Gateway device which offers, on one hand, dual communication both on vertical (between the network layers from the local, inferior, represented by IIoT, to the central, superior, represented by the Cloud) and on horizontal (between similar devices located on the same Edge level) and, on the other hand, can locally process data to take fast decisions which facilitate real-time process control. The validity of the proposed solution is supported by a case study performed on a flexible assembly/disassembly line (laboratory model).",

This study presents an investigation of the linkages between BDA capabilities, circular economy (CE) practices, and sustainable supply chain (SSC) flexibility on the SSC performance. Based on a survey of 320 manufacturing organisations, the study presents very interesting results. It is revealed that the BDA does not have a direct effect on sustainable performance. The CE practices and SSC flexibility are significant mediating variables between the BDA capabilities and SSC performance. The BDA is found to drive the implementation of CE practices. Further, CE practices are found to develop SSC flexibility with the BDA complementing these flexibilities.",

      "Title": "Data analysis of the electricity generation mix for clean energy transition during COVID-19 lockdowns",
      "Abstract": "This paper presents data analysis on the electricity generation mix during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. The main objective was to assess the percentage changes in energy supply (total energy generation, electricity generation from fossil fuels–coal and natural gas; renewables–solar PV, wind, Biomass, Hydro; and nuclear), energy demand (actual loads), and greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 emissions) during the COVID-19 lockdown and their impact on energy transition. The goal is to use energy data and facts during the COVID-19 pandemic to show the importance and the role of the development of clean energy systems in speeding up and fostering energy transition ((Decarbonization, Digitalization, and Decentralization). The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global health and economic crisis. Energy industry and energy transition play an important role in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and during economic recovery. The introduction starts with some facts on the energy and CO2 emissions during the COVID-19 lockdowns. A statistical analysis is used in this study to assess the electricity generation mix during COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. The data clearly shows a decline of both energy consumption (up to 10%) and greenhouse gas emissions (up to 20%). Electricity generation from renewables was the highest compared to fossil fuels (coal and natural gas) and nuclear fuel during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns for the European Countries. Electricity generation from coal, natural gas and nuclear plants decreased by up to 35, 25, and 20% and the share of renewable increased by up to 9%.during COVID-19 lockdowns compared to 2019. The results obtained in the course of this study visibly show the importance of the development of clean energy systems for energy transition and how crucial these clean energy technologies are crucial during a global health and economic crisis. A triple helix model (collaboration between the government, industry and academia) for innovation is needed in this pandemic crisis to overcome the challenges and to shape the future of the energy sector. The new opportunities and challenges for the energy transition due to impacts of COVID-19 are presented in detail in this paper. The post-COVID-19 energy sector should be different from the conventional centralized and fossil fuel-based systems. The future energy systems will be cleaner, sustainable, intelligent, self-reliant, reliable, flexible, and affordable.",

      "Title": "Building blocks for digital twin of reconfigurable machine tools from design perspective",
      "Abstract": "Reconfigurable machine tool (RMT) is the core facility of the reconfigurable manufacturing system (RMS), which can provide customised flexibility for RMS through reconfiguration. The reconfiguration of RMT is complicated due to unpredictable changes in demand and the flexibility of RMT, where new RMT should be designed to satisfy the new demand. The concept of digital twin of RMT is introduced to solve complex reconfiguration problems by executing reconfiguration experiments on high-fidelity virtual RMT. Considering the design processes of RMT during reconfiguration, three building blocks for digital twin of RMT should be studied thoroughly, including structure design, configuration generation, and configuration evaluation. First, the structure design of RMT for multi-part families is studied, including the design principles, module division, and design method. Second, the configuration generation process of RMT based on the results of the structure design is analysed, where quantitative description of configuration is proposed to facilitate the generation process. Third, configuration evaluation is presented to confirm the performance of each configuration based on kinematics analysis. Finally, a case study is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed three building blocks for digital twin of RMT during reconfiguration to obtain suitable design scheme of RMT.",

      "Title": "Advanced Fouling Management through Use of HTRI SmartPM: Case Studies from Total Refinery CDU Preheat Trains",
      "Abstract": "Heat exchanger fouling is a persistent problem contributing to process economics, plant capacity, environmental concerns, and safety. Advances in research on hydrocarbon fouling have changed the impact of fouling in crude refinery operations, through the use of rigorous performance monitoring and process optimization methods, use of fouling predictive models, use of fouling mitigation technologies (e.g., use of tube inserts), etc. This work presents case studies from two TOTAL refineries preheat trains where the exchangers are subject to fouling. TOTAL has implemented performance monitoring and predictive maintenance software (HTRI SmartPM™) throughout their refineries to improve existing fouling management practice. The software performs advanced data reconciliation, including simulation of detailed exchanger operational data using HTRI shell-and-tube heat exchanger calculation methods and inferring fouling resistance for individual shells for shells-in-series based on dynamic fouling behavior. Dynamic fouling models are used to assess the impact of fouling on the overall network performance. Several heat exchangers in the network have tube inserts (Turbotal® and Spirelf® inserts from Petroval), and their performances are monitored and predicted. The case studies demonstrate successful implementation of SmartPM software in TOTAL Normandy and Grandpuits refineries, enabling economically feasible, technically viable, and environmentally desirable decision-making for refinery operation.",

      "Title": "Development of a Cyber-Physical framework for monitoring and teleoperation of a CNC lathe based on MTconnect and OPC protocols",
      "Abstract": "Accompanying the changes in production strategies focused on the intensive use of information technologies, electronic manufacturing represents one of the first moves towards the development of intelligent factories, the main guideline of Industry 4.0. One of the great challenges of manufacturing companies is the acquisition of data in an integrated manner from CNC devices of different manufacturers. In this context, taking advantage of the fact that standards such as MTConnect and OPC-UA contribute to creating the path towards the development of the new industrial era, this paper presents the architecture of a framework implemented in the form of an internet-based client-server model for monitoring and teleoperation of CNC machine tools, which has attributes compliant with Industry 4.0. The concept of the framework was carried out through a methodological approach that involved the use of IDEF0 diagrams and the axiomatic design methodology for the refinement of the model. The computational implementation was based on the integration of servers in the form of services through the proposed CyberDNC web system. It was evaluated and validated through use cases focused on the connectivity between a CNC lathe with the servers, and those with the available web clients.",

      "Abstract": "Research in industry 4.0 is growing, driven by the innovations in production systems on a continuous basis. In this study, we identified the evolution of themes inherent in the industry 4.0 using a bibliometric software, namely SciMAT (Science Mapping Analysis Software Tool). The analyses included 1882 documents, 4231 keywords, and the relevant information was extracted based on frequency of co-occurrence of keywords. The clusters were plotted in two-dimensional strategic diagrams and analysed using the bibliometric indicators such as the number of publications, number of associated documents, and h-index. The results revealed that 2017 had the largest number of publications. Expert authors in the field and the periodicals that published the most were identified. The science mapping presented 31 clusters in which the most representative motor themes were CPS (Cyber-Physical System), IoT (Internet of Things), and Big Data. In addition, it was possible to identify fields with high investment of efforts by the scientific community such as the union between lean production and industry 4.0, production-centered CPS (CPPS), IoT (Industrial Internet of Things - IIoT), among others. The overlapping map showed an increase in the number of keywords from 338 to 1231 over the period of data. The map of scientific developments supported by an exhaustive research, it was possible to show the state of the art, the main challenges and perspectives for future research in the field of industry 4.0 such as Technology, Collaboration/Integration, Management and Implementation.",

      "Title": "Digital twin for smart manufacturing: a review of concepts towards a practical industrial implementation",
      "Abstract": "Latest trends and developments in digital technologies have enabled a new manufacturing model. Digital systems can monitor, optimize and control processes by creating a virtual copy of the physical world and making decentralized decisions. This paradigm relies on the development of a digital counterpart, the Digital Twin, for each production resource taking part to the whole manufacturing process. Although real applications of Digital Twin may differ in technical and operational details, in the past years, a huge effort has been done in order to identify and define focal functionalities and properties, as well as main challenges for the practical implementation within real factories. This paper is intended to review and analyse principles, ideas and technological solutions of the Digital Twin vision for production processes focusing on the practical industrial implementation. The purpose of this document is therefore to summarize the current state-of-art on Digital Twin concepts, and to draw their up-to-date state for application and deployment in real industrial processes. Finally, future directions for further research are discussed.",

      "Abstract": "Effective decision making is critical for operation and control of Internet of Things (IoT) systems. These systems are comprised of massive numbers of hardware, software and network components; all sensing, computing, communicating and controlling in dynamic architectures and state spaces of extraordinary complexity. Components, connections and users will come and go, quality and reliability will be unpredictable, and failures and intrusions will be ever-present. It is vital that these systems be rigorously designed, developed, and governed; but how can a rigorous engineering discipline be defined for an environment where the capability, connectivity, and integrity of components will vary from moment to moment? In this paper, we focus on Flow Semantics as a rigorous engineering foundation for analysis, development, evolution, operation, and governance of IoT systems in such unpredictable environments. The research goal is to develop engineering principles and practices for maintaining intellectual control in IoT systems for effective decision-making.",

      "Title": "A digital twin-enabled value stream mapping approach for production process reengineering in SMEs",
      "Abstract": "Nowadays agile and practical methods for lean manufacturing and production process reengineering are in urgent need for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). However, due to the limitations in obtaining accurate performance evaluations of the production line, traditional value stream mapping (VSM) methods are insufficient or unpractical in undertaking production process reengineering tasks. By integrating the internet of things (IoT) technology and Efficiency Validate Analysis (EVA) simulation framework, this paper proposed a digital twin-enabled VSM approach for SMEs. This easy to adopt and accurate method helps manufacturing SMEs in redesigning and reengineering production processes. This study contributes to research on digital twin modeling, by proposing a theoretical framework which combines IoT data-driven production process planning and simulation methods. The novelty of this study also exists in proposing a comprehensive and practical solution for production process reengineering, which integrating the cutting-edge technologies including digital twin and IoT. The feasibility and validity of the proposed approach is proved by applying to a musical instrument factory in China.",

      "Title": "Application of the Internet of Things in the textile industry",
      "Abstract": "The ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT) is at times mythologized and its purpose mistaken, and often people can become confused about what it means, does or aims to achieve; moreover, without a financial appraisal of the differences IoT can make to their own enterprise, business leaders may be content to watch and wait rather than to take a lead. This issue of Textile Progress aims to provide a guide to help navigation beyond general statements about IoT and to help those involved with the textile industry to make an informed decision about its potential value to them. The definitions of the Internet of Things (IoT) available in the literature, and those put forth by organizations working on IoT standards development, are reviewed along with its architecture, elements, standards and protocols to help provide an understanding of the concepts and goals of IoT. A broad overview of impediments challenging the progress of IoT, especially in relation to cybersecurity, is provided. This review also compares ongoing work in the application of IoT in the textile industry to that in other manufacturing sectors whilst focussing on the interpretation of IoT technologies and their potential application to the textile industry according to both technological and business perspectives. A specific case study for the spinning industry is conducted to help with evaluation of its IoT solutions and to help to address how other parts of the textile industry might benefit from its application. The case study includes evaluation of IoT solutions in the spinning industry spanning the period between ITMA 2011 to 2019, and takes information from interviews with industry executives to inform future directions of IoT in the spinning industry.",

      "Abstract": "The research proposes a metric referred to as Smart Manufacturing Performance Measures (SMPMs), which are mapped with manufacturing decisions (structural and infrastructural) and manufacturing outputs (cost, quality, delivery, flexibility, and innovativeness). The mapping between manufacturing decisions, manufacturing outputs, and SMPMs, facilitates the organization in choosing SMPMs to deliver desired output as represented by the competitive priority. The approach provides a direction for the practitioners to implement and operate smart manufacturing systems efficiently and effectively by devising a performance measurement system. A total of 22 performance measures are identified through an in-depth literature review. These are further classified into hard and soft measures, which allow decision-makers to measure SMPMs and focus on a specific performance measure. Further, SMPMs is linked to 13 enablers, which are the driving technologies for implementing smart manufacturing systems. Smart manufacturing is evolving, and its implementation is still in the nascent phase. The proposed approach plays a vital role in redefining the manufacturing strategy while deploying smart manufacturing systems. The research contribution is a step-in assessment of smart manufacturing to understand the ‘what’ and ‘how’ of technological changes are transforming the operations and driving outputs.",

      "Title": "The architectural framework of a cyber physical logistics system for digital-twin-based supply chain control",
      "Abstract": "Personalised production allows the supply chain (SC) to exist in various dynamic fluctuations within a make-to-order (MTO) environment. An SC for personalised production has redundant inventory and operation capacity; therefore, it requires a system that can achieve recoverability for operation resilience. Thus, a standalone cyber physical system (CPS) has limitation for SC control with MTO. To solve this problem, the CPS must be coordinated, and a systematic approach is required. This study proposes a cyber physical logistics system (CPLS) that is coordinated with the agent cyber physical production systems in a multi-level CPS structure. This multi-level architectural framework is designed to provide technical functionalities for resilient SC control. The service composition procedures of technical functionalities on the distributed digital twin (DT) simulation are divided into type and instance stages. The operation procedures of the DT application and technical functionality of the DT engine are suggested. The proposed CPLS has appropriate service composition and operation for the bullwhip and ripple effects, which are the two main SC-related problems. This study illustrates an early case of CPLS that can minimise differences among assets using distributed DT simulation; furthermore, the study establishes an SC and production plan based on the DT simulation results.",

      "Abstract": "The literature discusses data science (DS) as a very promising set of techniques and tools to support lean production (LP) practices. DS could aid manufacturing companies in transforming massive real-time data into meaningful knowledge, increasing process transparency and product quality information and supporting improvement activities through data-driven decision-making. However, no attempt has been made in the literature to formalise the links between DS and LP practices. Thus, this study aims to overcome this gap by clarifying the DS techniques and tools that can support LP practices and how to apply them. This study employs a quantitative bibliometric method–specifically, a keyword co-occurrence network analysis–on a set of papers extracted from Scopus. The results obtained allowed the researchers to identify a set of DS techniques and tools that can support LP practices and to develop a model to guide their implementation based on the typical improvement implementation stages of the plan-do-check-act cycle. The model shows how to use DS techniques and tools in LP for: identifying areas for improvement and subsequent implementation (plan); enabling a better knowledge and process management (do); identifying/predicting potential problems and employing statistical process control (check); providing remedial actions and effectively applying process improvement (act).",

The industry 4.0 paradigm encourages the usage of smart sensors, devices, and machines, to enable smart factories that continuously collect data pertaining to production. ML techniques enable the generation of actionable intelligence by processing the collected data to increase manufacturing efficiency without significantly changing the required resources. Additionally, the ability of ML techniques to provide predictive insights has enabled discerning complex manufacturing patterns and offers a pathway for an intelligent decision support system in a variety of manufacturing tasks such as intelligent and continuous inspection, predictive maintenance, quality improvement, process optimisation, supply chain management, and task scheduling. While different ML techniques have been used in a variety of manufacturing applications in the past, many open questions and challenges remain, from Big data curation, storage, and understanding, data reasoning to enable real-time actionable intelligence to topics such as edge computing and cybersecurity aspects of smart manufacturing. Hence, this special issue is focused on bringing together a wide range of researchers to report the latest efforts in the fundamental theoretical as well as experimental aspects of ML and their applications in manufacturing and productionsystems.",

      "Abstract": "In discrete event simulation (DES) models, stochastic behaviour is modelled by sampling random variates from probability distributions to determine event outcomes. However, the distribution of outcomes for an event from a real system is often dynamic and dependent on the current system state. This paper proposes the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) in DES models to determine the current distribution of each event outcome, conditional on the current model state or input data, from which random variates can then be sampled. This enables more realistic and accurate modelling of stochastic behaviour. An application is in digital twin models that aim to closely mimic a real system by learning from its past behaviour and utilising current data to predict its future. The benefits of the approach introduced in this paper are demonstrated through a realistic DES model of load-haul-dump vehicle operations in a production area of a sublevel caving mine.",

      "Abstract": "Augmented reality (AR) has proven to be an invaluable interactive medium to reduce cognitive load by bridging the gap between the task-at-hand and relevant information by displaying information without disturbing the user's focus. AR is particularly useful in the manufacturing environment where a diverse set of tasks such as assembly and maintenance must be performed in the most cost-effective and efficient manner possible. While AR systems have seen immense research innovation in recent years, the current strategies utilised in AR for camera calibration, detection, tracking, camera position and orientation (pose) estimation, inverse rendering, procedure storage, virtual object creation, registration, and rendering are still mostly dominated by traditional non-AI approaches. This restricts their practicability to controlled environments with limited variations in the scene. Classical AR methods can be greatly improved through the incorporation of various AI strategies like deep learning, ontology, and expert systems for adapting to broader scene variations and user preferences. This research work provides a review of current AR strategies, critical appraisal for these strategies, and potential AI solutions for every component of the computational pipeline of AR systems. Given the review of current work in both fields, future research work directions are also outlined.",

      "Title": "Trust in artificial intelligence within production management – an exploration of antecedents",
      "Abstract": "Industry 4.0, big data, predictive analytics, and robotics are leading to a paradigm shift on the shop floor of industrial production. However, complex, cognitive tasks are also subject of change, due to the development of artificial intelligence (AI). Smart assistants are finding their way into the world of knowledge work and require cooperation with humans. Here, trust is an essential factor that determines the success of human-AI cooperation. Within this article, an analysis within production management identifies possible antecedent variables on trust in AI and evaluates these due to interaction scenarios with AI. The results of this research are five antecedents for human trust in AI within production management. From these results, preliminary design guidelines are derived for a socially sustainable human-AI interaction in future production management systems. Practitioner summary: In the future, artificial intelligence will assist cognitive tasks in production management. In order to make good decisions, humans trust in AI has to be well calibrated. For trustful human-AI interactions, it is beneficial that humans subjectively perceive AI as capable and comprehensible and that they themselves are digitally competent.",

      "Abstract": "Digital twin models are computerized clones of physical assets or systems and have attracted much attention from academia and industries. Digital twin applications focus on smart manufacturing systems. Meanwhile, manufacturing products are driven increasingly by the needs of customers. Industrial production modes have evolved from mass production to personalized production. Understanding customers and meeting their personalized needs have become important issues in smart manufacturing. Social networks provide platforms for online customers to engage in different behaviors. In addition, personality recognition is a crucial issue for understanding people. In this study, a new technique is proposed to formalize personality as digital twin models by observing users’ posting content and liking behavior. A multitask learning deep neural network model is used to predict users’ personality through two types of data representation. Experimental results show that combining the two types of data can improve personality prediction accuracy.",

      "Title": "Covert Cognizance: A Novel Predictive Modeling Paradigm",
      "Abstract": "Can predictive models develop cognizance or awareness of how they have been used? Can models detect if they are being manipulated or executed in nonauthorized manners? Can a software track information propagation through its subroutines to improve execution efficiency? Can this be achieved in a covert manner, i.e., avoiding the use of additional variables, additional lines of code, and conventional logging files, and instead rely directly on the physics being simulated to develop the required cognizance? Achieving these goals under the looming threat of insiders is considered an open challenging problem. This paper introduces a new modeling paradigm to covertly develop cognizance that is of critical value when predictive software is used in both adversarial and nonadversarial settings. Given the wide range of applications possible with this new modeling paradigm, the paper will focus on introducing the mathematical theory and limit the initial demonstration to a physics-based model of a nuclear reactor. This model describes a representative industrial control system of a nuclear reactor model containing two coupled subsystems: a heat-producing core and a steam generator. The goal is to demonstrate how each subsystem physics model can remain cognizant of the state of the subsystem. The proposed methodology will provide communication solutions for future reactor technologies to enable advanced reactor control and remote reactor operations.",

Digital twin, a new emerging and fast growing technology which connects the physical and virtual world, has attracted much attention worldwide recently. This paper presents a new method for product design based on the digital twin approach. The development of product design is briefly introduced first.

A number of joint corporate/government initiatives also describe and encourage the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the operation and management of production lines. Machine learning will have a significant role to play in the delivery of automated and intelligently supported maintenance decision-making systems. While e-maintenance practice provides aframework for internet-connected operation of maintenance practice the advent of IoT has changed the scale of internetworking and new architectures and tools are needed. While advances in sensors and sensor fusion techniques have been significant in recent years, the possibilities brought by IoT create new challenges in the scale of data and its analysis. The development of audit trail style practice for the collection of data and the provision of acomprehensive framework for its processing, analysis and use should be avaluable contribution in addressing the new data analytics challenges for maintenance created by internet connected devices. This paper proposes that further research should be conducted into audit trail collection of maintenance data, allowing future systems to enable ‘Human in the loop’ interactions.",

Given the nonlinear dynamics and uncertainty involved during the process of machinery degradation, proper design and adaptability of a Digital Twin model remain a challenge. This paper presents a Digital Twin reference model for rotating machinery fault diagnosis. The requirements for constructing the Digital Twin model are discussed, and a model updating scheme based on parameter sensitivity analysis is proposed to enhance the model adaptability. Experimental data are collected from a rotor system that emulates an unbalance fault and its progression. The data are then input to a Digital Twin model of the rotor system to investigate its ability of unbalance quantification and localisation for fault diagnosis. The results show that the constructed Digital Twin rotor model enables accurate diagnosis and adaptive degradation analysis.",

The resources and the properties of them are first modelled in a digital environment able to simulate the real machine’s behaviour. Data are gathered by machines’ controllers and external sensors to be used for the synchronous tuning of the digital models and their simulation. The outcome of the simulation is then used to assess the resource’s condition and to calculate RUL. In this way, the condition and the status of the machines can be monitored and predicted as a result from the simulation of physics-based models, without invasive techniques of common predictive maintenance solutions. A case study is presented in this paper where the proposed methodology is validated by predicting the RUL of an industrial robot.",

      "Abstract": "Digital twin (DT) technology aims to create a virtual model of a physical entity and efficiently analyze the intelligent manufacturing system. Based on the DT, human-machine interaction (HMI) is a typical application. Deep learning technology is employed in the digital twin to realize and strengthen HMI while analyzing the physical and virtual data. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for analyzing visual information. For dealing with the HMI task in DT, two CNN models, Visual Geometry Group Network (VGG) and Residual Network (ResNet), are adopted. Modified 3D-VGG and 3D-ResNet models are proposed in this paper, which is an improvement over existing VGG and ResNet models. The models focus on humans’ information in videos that are captured with the HMI system’s sensors. The information, which can be regarded as the digital twin data, includes the action and the position of the human skeleton. Additionally, the proposed models are end-to-end. The experiments show that both models perform well on the human motion recognition task. The model can effectively generate skeletal data from video data. With the generated information, the human and the machine can interact well with the aid of the digital twin data analysis.",

      "Title": "A graph-based context-aware requirement elicitation approach in smart product-service systems",
      "Abstract": "The paradigm of Smart product-service systems (Smart PSS) has emerged recently owing to the edge-cutting Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The unique features of Smart PSS including smartness and connectedness, value co-creation and data-driven design manner, enable the collection and analysis of large volume and heterogeneous contextual data to extract useful knowledge. Therefore, requirement elicitation, as a critical process for new solution (i.e. product-service) design, can be conducted in a rather context-aware manner, assured by those massive user-generated data and product-sensed data during the usage stage. Nevertheless, despite a few works on semantic modelling, scarcely any reports on such mechanism in today's smart, connected environment. Aiming to fill this gap, for the first time, a graph-based context-aware requirement elicitation approach considering contextual information within the Smart PSS is proposed. It leverages the pre-defined product, service, and condition ontologies together with Deepwalk technique, to formulate those concepts as nodes and their relationships as the edge of the proposed requirement graph. Implicit stakeholder requirements within a specific context can be further derived based on such interrelationships in a data-driven manner. To demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness, an example of smart bike share system is addressed to illustrate the requirement elicitation process. It is hoped that this explorative study can offer valuable insights for the service providers who would like to extract requirements not only from the voice of customers but also from the user-generated data and product-sensed data.",

The research yields two main conclusions. First, the implementation of intelligent manufacturing has a significant role in promoting the financial performance and innovation performance of manufacturing enterprises. Second, technology-intensive industries improve the quantity of innovation by implementing intelligent manufacturing, thus promoting the improvement of short-term financial performance, but the improvement of innovation quality has a negative impact on short-term financial performance. In labour-intensive industries, the relationship between financial performance and innovation performance is not obvious.",

      "Abstract": "Nowadays, the emphasis on manufacturing has shifted from a manufacturer-dominating to a customer-centric manner by actively involving users into the co-creation process to realise individual satisfaction. In such era, the rapid development of information and communication technology (e.g. wireless sensor network, and cyber-physical systems) enables a promising market of IT-driven product, i.e. smart, connected product, and also changes the way of user–manufacturer interaction in the product development process. However, to the best of authors’ knowledge, co-creation manner in such context is scarcely reported. Meanwhile, there is a lack of any paradigms given to enable such product open innovation along the lifecycle for personalisation concerns. Aiming to fill this gap, this paper, as an explorative research, proposes a new product development paradigm, i.e. smart, connected open architecture product (SCOAP). It follows the adaptable design principles for product extendibility and lifecycle consideration. Moreover, it enlarges the scope of existing open architecture product by involving IT-driven innovation consideration as well. Hence, the definitions, characteristics, evaluation criteria, development method, and lifecycle co-creation context of SCOAP are presented in details. To make it more concrete, a demo project of a smart, connected open architecture bicycle is given at last.",

      "Abstract": "Industry 4.0 (I4.0) encompasses a plethora of digital technologies effecting on manufacturing enterprises. Most research on this topic examines the effects in the smart factory domain, focusing on production scheduling. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive research on the applications of I4.0 enabling technologies in manufacturing life-cycle processes. This paper is thus intended to provide a systematic literature review answering the following research question: What are the applications of I4.0 enabling technologies in the business processes of manufacturing companies? The study analyses 186 articles and the results show that production scheduling and control is the process most often investigated, while there is also an increasing trend in servitization and circular supply chain management. Moreover, there is extensive combined use of IoT, Big Data Analytics and Cloud, whose applications cover a wide range of processes. On the contrary, other technology like Blockchain is not as widely discussed in the domain of I4.0. This picture calls for a future research agenda extending the scope of investigation into I4.0 in manufacturing. Furthermore, the results of this research can prove extremely useful for practitioners who wish to implement one or more technologies, providing them with solutions for applications in manufacturing.",

      "Title": "Toward Digital Twin for Cyber Physical Production Systems Maintenance: Observation Framework Based on Artificial Intelligence Techniques",
      "Abstract": "Manufacturing Systems are considered complex engineering systems given the large number of integrated entities and their interactions. Unplanned events and disruptions that can happen at any time in real-word industrial environments increase the complexity of manufacturing production systems. In the fourth industrial revolution (so called Industry 4.0), the industrial sector is rapidly changing with emerging technologies like Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS), Internet of Thing (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), etc. However, the efficiency and reliability of these systems are still questionable in many circumstances. To address this challenge, an observation framework based on AI techniques aimed at elaborating predictive and reactive planning of the maintenance operations of CPPS is proposed in this paper. The proposed tool aims to improve the system’s reliability and helps the maintenance supervisors to adjust maintenance decisions. In order to assess the performance of the proposed tool, a case study on an industry-type learning factory is considered. A proof of concept shows the efficiency of the framework.",

      "Title": "Application of digital twins to the product lifecycle management of battery packs of electric vehicles",
      "Abstract": "Lithium-ion batteries have become a core component of electric vehicles (EVs) because of their high energy density. However, several issues in lithium-ion batteries usage, such as safety, durability, charging time, and driving range, limit the development of EVs. Meanwhile, with the emergence of Industry 4.0, the digital twins technology has received widespread attention in the manufacturing industry because it provides real-time monitoring and intelligent management of the production process. The authors propose a framework based on digital twins, which can be used for real-time monitoring, intelligent management, and autonomous control of battery packs. The framework covers all aspects of a battery pack's lifecycle, including design, manufacturing, operation monitoring, and second use options. Such a framework can solve some critical issues inhibiting the usage of batteries. A case study of the application of the proposed digital twins-based framework to electric vehicle battery systems has been conducted. The results show that deploying digital twins into the battery packs of EVs will improve the safety and service life of the battery packs.",

      "Abstract": "Predictive models are increasingly deployed within smart manufacturing for the control of industrial plants. With this arises, the need for long-term monitoring of model performance and adaptation of models if surrounding conditions change and the desired prediction accuracy is no longer met. The heterogeneous landscape of application scenarios, machine learning frameworks, hardware-restricted IIoT platforms, and the diversity of enterprise systems require flexible, yet stable and error resilient solutions that allow the automated adaptation of prediction models. Recommendations are provided for the application and management of predictive models in smart manufacturing. Typical causes for concept drift in real-world smart manufacturing applications are analysed, and essential steps in data and prediction model management are highlighted, to ensure reliability and efficiency in such applications. For this purpose, recommendations and a reference architecture for model management are provided. In addition, experimental results of two model adaptation strategies on an artificial dataset are shown.",

      "Title": "Modular manufacturing processes: Status, challenges, and opportunities",
      "Abstract": "Chemical companies are constantly seeking new, high-margin growth opportunities, the majority of which lie in high-grade, specialty chemicals, rather than in the bulk sector. To realize these opportunities, manufacturers are increasingly considering decentralized, flexible production facilities: large-scale production units are uneconomical for innovative products with a short lifespan and volatile markets. Small modular plants have low financial risks, are flexible and can respond rapidly to changes in demand. Logistics costs can be also reduced by moving production closer to customers and/or sources of raw materials. Moreover, stricter safety regulations can in many cases be more easily met using smaller distributed facilities. Modularization of chemical production can thus have potentially significant economic and safety benefits. In this article, several drivers for modular production are reviewed, and modular production architectures are evaluated based on a new metric, the value density of feedstock resources and markets for the products of a process. The links between modularization and process intensification are also discussed. Several industrial examples are provided and used to highlight challenges and future directions for this area. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 63: 4262–4272, 2017.",

      "Title": "Inventory diagnosis for flow improvement—A design science approach",
      "Abstract": "Improving flow is a core Operations Management theme that is set to become even more important following contemporary developments in manufacturing, such as smart products and digital encapsulation that enable new control concepts such as multi-agent holonic control. But, companies often struggle to realize flow improvements in practice, both with and without new technologies. While the literature agrees on the importance of flow, a structured and independent process that supports managers in identifying the root causes of why flow items wait in inventories instead of being processed is missing. Managers often use a single production management concept, such as lean production or the theory of constraints, when they seek to understand the reasons for a flow problem, which may lead to misdirected and unsuccessful interventions. In response, we use design science to develop a comprehensive approach to diagnosing flow problems that is independent from any production management concept. This diagnosis process results from successive iterations with five companies and supports the selection of appropriate analytical models and flow improvement solutions. It enables an organization to widen the focus of its flow improvement actions beyond the scope of a singular production management concept and complements the application of recent advances in technology, allowing smart products to quickly interpret what is happening in a location without first simulating and analyzing the whole system. Furthermore, the study expands buffer theories by showing that buffers have an internal hierarchy and can be absorbed by other buffers, while enhancing other theories related to coordination, material flow control, and lean improvement.",

      "Abstract": "Recently, the term “Industry 4.0” has emerged to characterize several Information Technology and Communication (ICT) adoptions in production processes (e.g., Internet-of-Things, implementation of digital production support information technologies). Business Analytics is often used within the Industry 4.0, thus incorporating its data intelligence (e.g., statistical analysis, predictive modelling, optimization) expert system component. In this paper, we perform a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the usage of Business Analytics within the Industry 4.0 concept, covering a selection of 169 papers obtained from six major scientific publication sources from 2010 to March 2020. The selected papers were first classified in three major types, namely, Practical Application, Reviews and Framework Proposal. Then, we analysed with more detail the practical application studies which were further divided into three main categories of the Gartner analytical maturity model, Descriptive Analytics, Predictive Analytics and Prescriptive Analytics. In particular, we characterized the distinct analytics studies in terms of the industry application and data context used, impact (in terms of their Technology Readiness Level) and selected data modelling method. Our SLR analysis provides a mapping of how data-based Industry 4.0 expert systems are currently used, disclosing also research gaps and future research opportunities.",

The digital transformation should strengthen the competitiveness of commercial enterprises, while enabling desirable ways of working at the same time. The digital transformation is an opportunity to shed some light on the role of the human individual in digital manufacturing and the business development potential of a human-centered work design. Measures taken to adapt work to people refer to technical-ergonomic conditions and/or to substantive-organizational conditions of the work activity. Immersion, that is, complete immersion in the virtual world by means of head-mounted displays or projections, addresses as many human senses as possible, in order to achieve a realistic simulation. The digital transformation is changing human work and workload patterns.",

      "Abstract": "With ‘smart’ being the order of the day, the shift in the landscape of a typical production-oriented manufacturing environment to a more data-oriented, automated and smart manufacturing is imminent. However, what is meant by smart manufacturing? And how can smart manufacturing contribute to a bigger picture by acting as enablers of smart cities? Given the paucity in literature that seeks to make sense in this direction, herein, first, six indices that represent or define a smart city are identified. Then, a holistic perspective of smart manufacturing is presented by collectively dwelling into the concepts of cyber physical production systems (CPPS) and industrial symbiosis—the recent and ongoing developments, applications, and relevant examples. In each subsequent section, the Review addresses how smart manufacturing contributes to smart cities, not just from a technology perspective, but also by satisfying the ergonometric factors and sustainability issues which are equally important indices that make up a smart city. A brief overview of Singapore as a smart nation and smart manufacturing hub is presented toward the end, along with highlights of a real-world smart manufacturing platform called the Model Factory and its relevant modules.",

Consequently, a major challenge in the coming years will be to test people over the age of 60 years to detect pre-frailty at the earliest stage and to return them to robustness using the targeted interventions that are becoming increasingly available. This challenge requires individual longitudinal monitoring (ILM) or follow-up of community-dwelling older persons using quantitative approaches. This paper briefly describes an effort to tackle this challenge. Extending the detection of the pre-frail stages to other population groups is also suggested. Appropriate algorithms have been used to begin the tracing of faint physiological signals in order to detect transitions from robustness to pre-frailty states and from pre-frailty to frailty states. It is hoped that these studies will allow older adults to receive preventive treatment at the correct institutions and by the appropriate professionals as early as possible, which will prevent loss of autonomy. Altogether, ILM is conceived as an emerging property of databases (“digital twins”) and not the reverse. Furthermore, ILM should facilitate a coordinated set of actions by the caregivers, which is a complex challenge in itself. This approach should be gradually extended to all ages, because frailty has no age, as is testified by overwork, burnout, and post-traumatic syndrome.",

      "Title": "Industrial smart product-service system development for lifecycle sustainability concerns",
      "Abstract": "Industrial smart product-service system (ISPSS), as an emerging industrial digital servitisation paradigm, has attracted ever-increasing attentions from both industries and academics recently. The prevailing adoption of cutting-edge information and communication technologies, digital technologies and artificial intelligence has enabled the engineering lifecycle management in an ever-smarter manner with context awareness. Nevertheless, little study has provided any systematic process to prescribe its sustainable development throughout the engineering lifecycle, let alone any to consider sustainability in the cyber space other than the physical components. Aiming to fill the gap, this work outlines the definition, key features and social, economic and environmental concerns of the proposed sustainable ISPSS, and further proposes a systematic four-phase cyberphysical development framework by referring to the ISO14001:2015 standards. As a short communication, it is hoped this research can attract more open discussion and in-depth investigation towards sustainable ISPSS development in the near future.",

Hyper‐personalization and citizen/consumer involvement are at the heart of the Internet of I.AM. This chapter discusses the main features and characteristics of the I.AM. With the I.AM, an organization can be represented as a set of interactions that flow between internal actors and between the organization and its external stakeholders. Commerce is an excellent example of the profound changes occurring in the way of doing business in the era of the I.AM, with the key role of valuing the common good. The business model is a tool that describes how to create, deliver and capture value for a business. It is based on the response to the latent expectations of consumer citizens and forecasting intelligence. The business cost structure describes the most important costs associated with operating a business model.",

Identifying the future state of a business is one of the hardest exercises. To define the most likely future state of the business, the chapter recommends a three‐step process: create a customer‐back engagement journey map; identify decision points; and build the business value‐chain. It discusses major steps in any data journey for technology strategy building. When building an AI digital business case, value creation is clearly articulated through financial returns and additional, measurable benefits. The chapter describes the SLOPE framework where the AI capabilities are classified for their primary purpose of Sensing, Learning, Optimizing, Predicting, and Entropy. Establishing a good governance process around AI initiatives is as important as building a good framework to initiate and manage them.",

      "Title": "Towards adaptive scheduling of maintenance for Cyber-Physical Systems",
      "Abstract": "Scheduling and control of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are becoming increasingly complex, requiring the development of new techniques that can effectively lead to their advancement. This is also the case for failure detection and scheduling component replacements. The large number of factors that influence how failures occur during operation of a CPS may result in maintenance policies that are time-monitoring based, which can lead to suboptimal scheduling of maintenance. This paper investigates how to improve maintenance scheduling of such complex embedded systems, by means of monitoring in real-time the critical components and dynamically adjusting the optimal time between maintenance actions. The proposed technique relies on machine learning classification models in order to classify component failure cases vs. non-failure cases, and on real-time updating of the maintenance policy of the sub-system in question. The results obtained from the domain of printers show that a model that is responsive to the environmental changes can enable consumable savings, while keeping the same product quality, and thus be relevant for industrial purposes.",

During the past decades, there were major changes in the energy industry: the increased implementation of renewable generation, together with a greater use of electronic power elements in the network such as high-voltage DC links and the use of flexible AC transmission system and new market requirements, introduce new challenges and a need for more intelligent assets monitoring; and additional optimisation with a better balance in the combination of different energy sources and thus guaranteeing the reliability of supply and quality of energy; together with the identification of new business models that allow the integration of new technologies, neutralising cyber threats and ensure an adequate dissemination of knowledge to new generations. Companies are migrating to a more digital model based fundamentally on three pillars: communications, big data and artificial intelligence. The right combination of these three pillars will optimise the operation of the electrical system, reducing costs and polluting emissions, accelerating the adoption of non-polluting energies and renewable energies, while maximising economic performance and a closer way of interacting with users. The industrial Internet of things (IIoT) has been identified as one of the technologies with most potential impact in the next years.",

      "Abstract": "As technology advances unleash ubiquitous access to inexpensive and highly powerful means for computation, cyber-physical systems are increasingly becoming an integral part of real-world applications such as manufacturing and consumer electronics. With sophisticated computational functionality implemented as software, these systems are rapidly becoming intelligent and autonomous. Advances in low latency and high throughput reliable communication are enabling such autonomous systems to be networked and interconnected for collaborative operation. The new and evolving capabilities of autonomous and connected engineering systems mean that these intelligent cyber-physical systems are becoming more complex and therefore more challenging to design, test, and operate. This chapter introduces a classification of intelligent cyber-physical systems along two key axes: the behavior dimension launched by the advances in computation, which corresponds to the degree of autonomy in the systems, and the configuration dimension catalyzed by the advances in communication, which refers to the scale of the system in terms of the number of connected elements that comprise it. Based on this classification, the chapter explores practical challenges that may arise throughout the design-test-operation lifecycle of such systems and outlines the various ways in which computational models can provide value in addressing those challenges.",

Applications for the industrial sector are already numerous: predictive maintenance, improved decision-making in real time, anticipation of stocks according to the progress of production, etc. So many improvements that optimize the production tools every day a little more, and point to possibilities for the future of Industry 4.0, the crossroads of an interconnected global world. This work comes to contribute as a part of this industrial evolution(Usine 4.0).

      "Abstract": "Collaborative prognosis is a technique that is used to enable assets to improve their ability to predict failures by learning from the failures of similar other assets. This is typically made possible by enabling the assets to communicate with each other. The key enabler of current collaborative prognosis techniques is that they require assets to share their sensor data and failure information between each other, which might be a major constraint due to commercial sensitivities, especially when the assets belong to different companies. This study uses federated learning to address this issue and examines whether this technique will enable collaborative prognosis while ensuring sensitive operational data is not shared between organisational boundaries. An example implementation is demonstrated for the prognosis of a simulated turbofan fleet, where federated averaging algorithm is used as an alternative for the data exchange step. Its performance is compared with a conventional collaborative prognosis that involves failure data exchange. The results confirm that federated averaging retains the performance of conventional collaborative prognosis while eliminating the exchange of failure data within assets. This removes a critical hindrance in industrial adoption of collaborative prognosis, thus enhancing the potential of predictive maintenance.",

      "Title": "Integration of digital twin and deep learning in cyber-physical systems: towards smart manufacturing",
      "Abstract": "Digital twin (DT) is gaining popularity due to its significant impacts on bridging the gap between the physical and cyber worlds. As reported by Grand View Research, Inc., the global market of DT is expected to reach $26.07 billion by 2025 with a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 38.2%. The growing adoption of cyber-physical system (CPS), Internet of Things, big data analytics, and cloud computing in manufacturing sector has paved the way for low cost and systematic implementation of DT, with promising impacts on (a) product design and development, (b) machine and equipment health monitoring, and (c) product support and services. Successful implementation of DT would increase transparency, cooperation, flexibility, resilience, production speed, scalability, and manufacturing efficiency. Realisation of smart manufacturing requires collaborative and autonomous interactions between sensing, networking, and computational resources across manufacturing assets where data is gathered from physical systems is utilised for the extraction of actionable insights and provision of predictive services. In this study, a reference architecture based on deep learning, DT, and 5C-CPS is proposed to facilitate the transformation towards smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0.",

From a knowledge representation point of view, Internet of Things (IoT) is confronted with two main challenges associated with the use of data produced by interconnected Things - interoperability and integration. In order to support the evolution of IoT, this chapter introduces the IoT-O, providing the foundation for enabling interoperability and integration, and describes the digital twin approach, which enables the enhancing of physical IoT devices with auxiliary \"digital\" features. It also describes these two contributions within the scope of the Semantic Web of Things (SWoT) Reference Architecture. The chapter discusses three types of SWoT architecture participants: cloud resources, fog resources, and devices. Combining the concept of the digital twin with the provisioning of communication support enables the creation of SWoT-based architectural solutions, which enable the seamless participation of heterogeneous physical devices and software components in order to realize added-value applications.",

      "Abstract": "With the development of IoT technologies, digital twin has become an increasingly popular concept that is considered the next generation of digitalization for decision making support (human-oriented) and even fully autonomous. However, although there are a few research projects that have proposed available digital twin architectures, they are either missing critical components or difficult to be converted into a practical application. In this article, everything we proposed had been implemented in our production environment and is facilitating our manufacturing and mining processes. It is initiated by a data analytic maturity model which formulates the evaluation route of data analytics. Then, a novel six-layer digital twin model is established that aims to set the standards. In this model, we defined that all the automated calculation jobs should be driven by digital twin metadata such as the hyperparameters of machine learning. The metadata will be updated by metadata updating feedback flow which most current digital twin projects are missing.",

      "Abstract": "In this age of technology, the vision of manufacturing industries built of smart factories is not a farfetched future. As a prerequisite for Industry 4.0, industrial sectors are moving towards digitalization and automation. Despite its tremendous growth reaching a sales value of worth $188 billion in 2017, the biopharmaceutical sector distinctly lags in this transition. Currently, the challenges are innovative market disruptions such as personalized medicine as well as increasing commercial pressure for faster and cheaper product manufacturing. Improvements in digitalization and data analytics have been identified as key strategic activities for the next years to face these challenges. Alongside, there is an emphasis by the regulatory authorities on the use of advanced technologies, proclaimed through initiatives such as Quality by Design (QbD) and Process Analytical Technology (PAT). In the manufacturing sector, the biopharmaceutical domain features some of the most complex and least understood processes. Thereby, process models that can transform process data into more valuable information, guide decision-making, and support the creation of digital and automated technologies are key enablers. This review summarizes the current state of model-based methods in different bioprocess related applications and presents the corresponding future vision for the biopharmaceutical industry to achieve the goals of Industry 4.0 while meeting the regulatory requirements.",

      "Abstract": "As the days pass, the amount of work to do increases day by day, so there is a considerable need to automate the work. This necessity has led to the invention of a new technology named Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence or Machine Intelligence is a branch of science that deals with a machine's ability to learn, understand, think, and act like humans. The main goal of Artificial Intelligence is making machines to learn from the environment and make them capable of doing the given tasks successfully, that helps in maximizing their goal achievements. Artificial Intelligence is interdisciplinary, which has subfields such as Machine learning, Deep Learning, and others. Machine learning makes the machines automatically learn from their experience; it is done with computer programs that access the given data and uses it for learning for themselves. Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning that processes or filters information in the same way as the human brain. Here, it uses a computer model that takes the input and filters it through different layers to predict and classify the information. These three fields Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, made many advancements in technology in every sector that transformed the world into a new dimension.",

To leverage these developments, our aim in this perspective paper is centered around exploring numerous principle concepts to address the challenges of (i) trustworthiness and generalizability in developing data-driven models to shed light on understanding the fundamental trade-offs in their accuracy and efficiency and (ii) seamless integration of interface learning and multifidelity coupling approaches that transfer and represent information between different entities, particularly when different scales are governed by different physics, each operating on a different level of abstraction.

      "Title": "The Role of a Digital Industry 4.0 in a Renewable Energy System",
      "Abstract": "The transition to an intermittent energy production from renewable energy sources (RES) increases the complexity of providing reliable energy supply in Germany. Yet the growing number of RES impede the necessary effort to control the system. The introduction of digital or smart energy systems is often proclaimed as a logical next step towards coping with this rising complexity. It seems convenient that the manufacturing industry, as one of the major energy consumers, is currently also in a process of a digital transition, the fourth industrial revolution. This paper explores the current state of expert discourse on the role of a digitized industry as a potential enabler for the energy transition using Germany as a case study. For this purpose, we gathered qualitative data through semistructured interviews among industry managers and energy researchers. We identified the three major areas in the expert discourse of industry's future potentials: (1) increasing transparency in the energy system, (2) providing demand flexibility, and (3) increasing energy efficiency. In this paper, we address the internal barriers and explore industry's reluctance to interact with the energy system in order to initiate a transition.",

      "Abstract": "This article proposes a Digital Twin (DT) framework for the whole life cycle of batteries. Specifically, in the stage of R&D, Digital twin can integrate the data of all technical fields into one model to optimize the battery's performance. During the manufacturing and production phase, DT can establish a digital production line and workshop to improve it. In the operation stage, aiming at various fault features in the battery operation process, with the assistance of large data samples, digital twin simulation is used to determine the fault status of the equipment accurately, to realize the self-perception, judgment, error correction, early warning and other functions of the equipment. The article also proposes a Postoperation phase to recycle the battery to resolve the battery materials shortage problem. The critical research direction is a futuristic plan of battery communication with a charging Station, Battery Swapping System, Smart Grid, and Renewable resources. This sophisticated DT can comprehensively improve the energy system's entire life cycle management. Moreover, it can help perceive customer demand and offer an efficient operation mode to reduce running costs.",

      "Abstract": "A Digital Twin is a virtual representation of a physical product, asset, process, system, or service that allows us to understand, predict, and optimise their performance for better business outcomes. Recently, the use of Digital Twin in industrial operations has attracted the attention of many scholars and industrial sectors. Despite this, there is still a need to identify its value in industrial operations mainly in production, predictive maintenance, and after-sales services. Similarly, the implementation of a Digital Twin still faces many challenges. In response, a systematic literature review and analysis of 41 papers published between 2016 and 11 July 2020 have been carried out to examine recently published works in the field. Future research directions in the area are also highlighted. The result reveals that, regardless of the challenges, the role of Digital Twin in the advancement of industrial operations, especially production and predictive maintenance is highly significant. However, its role in after-sales services remains limited. Insights are offered for research scholars, companies, and practitioners to understand the current state-of-the-art and challenges, and to indicate future research possibilities in the field.",
