      "Title": "UPSARA: A Model-Driven Approach for Performance Analysis of Cloud-Hosted Applications",
      "Abstract": "Accurately analyzing the sources of performance anomalies in cloud-based applications is a hard problem due both to the multi tenant nature of cloud deployment and changing application workloads. To that end many different resource instrumentation and application performance modeling frameworks have been developed in recent years to help in the effective deployment and resource management decisions. Yet, the significant differences among these frameworks in terms of their APIs, their ability to instrument resources at different levels of granularity, and making sense of the collected information make it extremely hard to effectively use these frameworks. Not addressing these complexities can result in operators providing incompatible and incorrect configurations leading to inaccurate diagnosis of performance issues and hence incorrect resource management. To address these challenges, we present UPSARA, a model-driven generative framework that provides an extensible, lightweight and scalable performance monitoring, analysis and testing framework for cloud-hosted applications. UPSARA helps alleviate the accidental complexities in configuring the right resource monitoring and performance testing strategies for the underlying instrumentation frameworks used. We evaluate the effectiveness of UPSARA in the context of representative use cases highlighting its features and benefits.",

The system works as a Multi agent system and it is based on Arduino Uno boards, each one hosting an intelligent agent. The system was developed as test equipment for an active intelligent water meter for a SMART CITY project. The proposed system can be generalized and usable also with very simple (and therefore economical) computational units and allows to delocalize in similar units the computational load exceeding the single node capability; a specific data protocol, based on I2C, is used to share the knowledge between agents.",

      "Title": "Creating Domain Non-functional Requirements Software Product Line Engineering Using Model Transformations",
      "Abstract": "Requirement Engineering (RE) process during product development produces core artifacts to be analyzed during domain analysis phase of Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE). The product RE process can be a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document, use case models or other artifacts containing both functional and nonfunctional requirements of the product. The analysis of these artifacts is a time consuming and error-prone process when performed manually. There is also a need for creating consistent and complete set of non-functional requirements from user-specific individual projects in SPL. Therefore, we propose a methodology to create Domain Non-Functional Requirements (DNFRs) from Product Non-Functional Requirements (PNFRs) using model driven approach. Two model transformations are performed to automate the process of DNFR creation. First transformation converts PNFR into Product Line Non-Functional Requirements (PLNFR) using a PNFR meta model. The second transformation converts the PLNFR into DNFR using DNFR meta model. This transformation exploits commonality and variability among the products in terms of their non-functional requirements. The resulting DNFR can serve as a useful baseline for domain analysis in SPLE.",

As the embedded system is connected to the network, adaptation to various environmental changes was required. Self-adaptive systems have been researched to adapt to environmental changes. Also, due to the expansion of the system, concepts for operating the multiple system have emerged. However, studies to verify self-adaptive systems are lacking. In this paper, to verify the self-adaptation of the multiple system, a heterogeneous IoT device constituting the IoT ecosystem is represented by a State Diagram-based System Model. We confirmed the conflict problem between heterogeneous IoT devices through System Model of IoT Device.

However, information about energy consumption is not directly accessible through software development environ- ments, making it difficult to reuse the knowledge provided by existing energy-consumption experimental studies. To address this limitation, this paper presents a solution to enrich An- droid Studio with energy consumption information. We have developed a Green Security Plugin that provides energy-aware information to developers that make use of Android Security API. This plugin has been developed taking advantage of the functionalities provided by the HADAS toolkit.

      "Abstract": "It is our claim that the adoption of software engineering reuse techniques can leverage MAS development, mostly when we consider similar applications belonging to the same domain. MAS-Product Line (MAS-PL) raises as an interesting approach that uses Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) techniques and AOSE to manage the commonalities (similarities) and variabilities (differences) of such MAS applications. Although MAS present specific characteristics that could be considered when describing the system variability, existing work on MAS-PL is devoted to deal with MAS variability considering only domain-specific issues. Moreover, the adoption of variability models such as feature models should be considered for describing both Generic and Specific MAS variability. We propose a MAS-PL approach to address the aforementioned issues by representing Generic MAS variability according to MAS concepts such as agents, environment, interaction and organization, and Specific MAS variability according to a specific application domain. We evaluate the approach by deriving a family of agents that perform jobs in the Multi-Agent Contest environment.",

Therefore, flexibility and extendibility are two important quality attributes that should be taken into consideration when designing Smart City Applications. In this paper, we propose the Smart City Application Modeling Framework (SCAMF) for analyzing and designing Smart City applications that is based on the concept of Clean Architecture and adopts the representation formalism of feature models. SCAMF methodology is evaluated through a case study on a Smart Retail Platform. Quality indices like flexibility, extendibility along with metrics as complexity, cohesion and design size are compared to the initial version of the application that was completely re-engineered due to maintenance problems. The results of the study suggest that the proposed methodology improves quality indices like flexibility and extendibility up to 120%.",

      "Abstract": "The HyVar project (www.hyvar-project.eu/) proposes a development framework for continuous and individualized evolution of distributed software applications running on remote devices in heterogeneous environments, focusing on the automotive domain. The framework combines variability modeling and software reuse from software product lines with formal methods and software upgrades and can be integrated in existing software development processes. HyVar’s objectives are: (O1) To develop a Domain Specific Variability Language (DSVL) and tool chain to support software variability for highly distributed applications; (O2) to develop a cloud infrastructure that exploits software variability as described in the DSVL to track the software configurations deployed on remote devices and to enable (i) the collection of data from the devices to monitor their behavior; and (ii) secure and efficient customized updates; (O3) to develop a technology for over-the-air updates of distributed applications, which enables continuous software evolution after deployment on complex remote devices that incorporate a system of systems; and (O4) to test HyVar’s approach as described in the above objectives in an industry-led demonstrator to assess in quantifiable ways its benefits. The end of the project is approaching and we are close to reaching all the objectives. In this paper, we present the integrated tool chain, which combines formal reuse through software product lines with commonly used industrial practices, and supports the development and deployment of individualized software adaptations. We also describe the main benefits for the stakeholders involved.",

      "Abstract": "Cyber-physical systems interact closely at runtime with their operational context, i.e., other systems, users, and external entities. Therefore, eliciting and documenting interactions with the operational context allows documenting rationales for design decisions, which is essential to define a system architecture that suits the system's purpose. For cyber-physical systems acting in system networks, this task becomes challenging since these networks can change at runtime, because individual systems can leave or join a network spontaneously. Hence, it becomes impossible to predict at design time the operational contexts at runtime. To aid context analysis and specification of such systems, this paper contributes a solution approach where the context of a system is not defined based on a static system boundary but depends on the specific intended use. We propose a view-centric perception of the operational context to leverage the functionality of external systems. This allows differentiating between functionality offered by the cyber-physical system network as a whole and the functionality provided by each individual system. An evaluation with an industrial case example and industry collaboration shows that this approach allows making suitable assumptions of the operational context at design time to guide architecture decisions.",

      "Title": "Optimal reconfiguration of dynamic software product lines based on performance-influence models",
      "Abstract": "Today's adaptive software systems (i) are often highly configurable product lines, exhibiting hundreds of potentially conflicting configuration options; (ii) are context dependent, forcing the system to reconfigure to ever-changing contextual situations at runtime; (iii) need to fulfill context-dependent performance goals by optimizing measurable nonfunctional properties. Usually, a large number of consistent configurations exists for a given context, and each consistent configuration may perform differently with regard to the current context and performance goal(s). Therefore, it is crucial to consider nonfunctional properties for identifying an appropriate configuration. Existing black-box approaches for estimating the performance of configurations provide no means for determining context-sensitive reconfiguration decisions at runtime that are both consistent and optimal, and hardly allow for combining multiple context-dependent quality goals. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive approach based on Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL) for obtaining consistent and optimal reconfiguration decisions. We use training data obtained from simulations to learn performance-influence models. A novel integrated runtime representation captures both consistency properties and the learned performance-influence models. Our solution provides the flexibility to define multiple context-dependent performance goals. We have implemented our approach as a standalone component. Based on an Internet-of-Things case study using adaptive wireless sensor networks, we evaluate our approach with regard to effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability",

      "Title": "Industry 4.0 Interface for Dynamic Reconfiguration of an Open Lab Size Automated Production System to Allow Remote Community Experiments",
      "Abstract": "Nowadays, there are various use cases and proprietary demonstrators for Industry 4.0 or Cyber Physical Production Systems (CPPS) developed, operated and maintained by one or multiple research institutions. Within the development of new technologies for Industry 4.0, such demonstrators are used to support the interaction with the physical world, i.e. the machinery containing sensors and actuators. In this paper, we propose a concept that allows remote access using an Industry 4.0 interface on an open lab size automated production system (aPS), which has been available and used as a research community demonstrator for more than 5 years. Besides availability of evolution scenarios in various models and code, offering the possibility to conduct experiments from remote enables easier access and opportunities to interact with an aPS and provides a basis for concepts like production as a service and other research areas. The proposed concept is based on a model-driven approach that allows a dynamic reconfiguration of automation control code and generates a middleware interface. The middleware dynamically offers the possibility to retrieve information about the aPS and to control it via web services.",

      "Title": "Combining Business Process Variability and Software Variability Using Traceable Links",
      "Abstract": "Nowadays, domains like Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT) are highly affected by short product cycles and high pricing pressure. Business Process oriented organizations are known to perform better in such flexible environments. However, especially industries which are focused on delivering low cost systems are facing big challenges if the according business processes are not aligned with the capabilities of the product. Consequently, development effort is spent for features which are never addressed by any business goal. With this work, we propose to use a combined variability management in order to create an integrated view on the product variability from an organizational point as well as from a technical view. Using this approach helps in order to identify business drivers as well as to establish a mature product line development.",

      "Abstract": "Based on specific requirements, various Internet of Things (IoT) devices participate in multiple cross-organizational business processes. However, to achieve the desired business value, these IoT resources must be managed efficiently. Configurable Process Model (CPM) facilitates flexibility and reuse by sharing a family of process variants, which can be customized based on concrete business requirements. The classical approaches to develop CPMs focus mainly on the control-flow perspective, without providing concepts to tackle the complexity involved in the IoT domain. In this paper, we address this research gap by proposing configuration concepts for modeling IoT resource variability, which arises due to specific resource properties and behavior such as Replication and Shareability, at the CPM level. Furthermore, we validate our approach based on the results of our experimentation and demonstrate its feasibility through an implemented prototype.",

      "Abstract": "Developing Internet of Things (IoT) systems is not trivial and needs to be performed systematically to derive an IoT system that meets the required functional and non-functional concerns. Since IoT is applied to different heterogeneous domains usually a one-size-fits-all method is less feasible. For some cases a lightweight method with a few method artefacts are sufficient while in other cases a detailed set of method artefacts over the whole lifecycle might be required. So far, a few IoT system development methods (SDM) have been provided that include the steps necessary for guiding the development of IoT systems but these do not explicitly consider the situational needs for the required IoT method. In this paper we propose a situational method engineering (SME) approach for developing a method base that includes a broad set of method fragments which can be reused to develop customized methods. We illustrate the development of the method base using the existing IoT methods that have been proposed in the literature so far. Further we show how the method base can be used to develop methods for two different cases.",

      "Title": "Test Control Algorithms for the Validation of Cyber-Physical Systems Product Lines",
      "Abstract": "Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) product lines appear in a wide range of applications of different domains (e.g., car's doors' windows, doors of a lift, etc.). The variability of these systems is large and as a result they can be configured into plenty of configurations. Testing each of the configurations can be time consuming as not only software has to be simulated, but also the hardware and the physical layer of the CPS, which is often modelled with complex mathematical models. Choosing the adequate test control strategy is critical when testing CPSs product lines. This paper presents a set of test control algorithms organized in an architecture of three layers (domain, application and simulation) for testing CPSs product lines. An illustrative example of a CPS product line is presented and three experiments are conducted to measure the performance of the proposed test control algorithms. We conclude that test scheduling and test suite minimization significantly help to reduce the overall test costs while preserving the test quality in CPSs product lines. In addition, we conclude that knowing the results of the previously tested configurations permits reducing the time for the detection of anomalous designs.",

      "Abstract": "Energy is a critical resource, and designing a sustainable software architecture is a non-Trivial task. Developers require energy metrics that support sustainable software architectures reflecting quality attributes such as security, reliability, performance, etc., identifying what are the concerns that impact more in the energy consumption. A variability model of different designs and implementations of an energy model should exist for this task, as well as a service that stores and compares the experimentation results of energy and time consumption of each concern, finding out what is the most eco-efficient solution. The experimental measurements are performed by energy experts and researchers that share the energy model and metrics in a collaborative repository. HADAS confronts these tasks modelling and reasoning with the variability of energy consuming concerns for different energy contexts, connecting HADAS variability model with its energy efficiency collaborative repository, establishing a Software Product Line (SPL) service. Our main goal is to help developers to perform sustainability analyses finding out the eco-friendliest architecture configurations. A HADAS toolkit prototype is implemented based on a Clafer model and Choco solver, and it has been tested with several case studies.",

      "Title": "A Variability Model for Store-Oriented Software Ecosystems: An Enterprise Perspective",
      "Abstract": "Pioneers of today’s software industry like Salesforce and Apple have established successful ecosystems around their software platforms. Architectural knowledge of the existing ecosystems is implicit and fragmented among online documentation. In protection of intellectual property, existing documentation hardly reveals influential business strategies that affect the ecosystem structure. Thus, other platform providers can hardly learn from the existing ecosystems in order to systematically make reasonable design decisions with respect to their business strategies to create their own ecosystems. In this paper, we identify a variability model for architectural design decisions of a store-oriented software ecosystem product line from an enterprise perspective, comprising business, application, and infrastructure views. We derive the variability model from fragmentary material of existing ecosystems and a rigorous literature review using a research method based on the design science paradigm. To show its validity, we describe real-world ecosystems from diverse domains using the variability model. This knowledge helps platform providers to develop customized ecosystems or to recreate existing designs in a systematic way. This, in turn, contributes to an increase in designer and developer productivity.",

Then, we propose a distributed multi-agent architecture to unify numbers of different IoT applications by designing the software-defined sensors, auctuators and controllers. Furthermore, we analyze the proposed architecture and clarify why and how it can tackle the heterogeneity of IoT applications, enable them to interoperate with each other, make it efficient to introduce new applications, and enhance the flexibility and security of different applications. Finally, the use case of smart home with multiple applications is applied to verify the feasibility of the proposed solution for IoT architecture.",

      "Abstract": "Due to rapid changes in customer requirements, production systems constantly need to evolve. Together with the increasing penetration of internet, this everlasting evolution process is one of the main drivers to implement Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS). Therefore, this paper proposes to enhance evolution support besides the raw implementation of changes on the cyber level of CPPSs. Enhancements are done by using inherent experience of machines that are augmented by additional experience of similar machines at potentially remote locations. This contribution presents a CPPS structure and terminology for an evolution-aware capability based on evolution steps and shows the potential for using experience. In order to streamline evolution, the concept of a machine evolution community is presented that enables discovery and propagation of evolutionary steps in a CPPS with respect to different evolutionary use cases.",

Although these results are freely available, it is not easy for a developer to apply this knowledge to their applications. Consequently, in this paper we present the HADAS eco-assistant, whose usefulness is: (i) the researchers will store their results in a freely available repository; (ii) developers will be able to reason and get the most energy-efficient configurations that meet their requirements.

IoT environments are complex, dynamic, rapidly changing and resource constrained. Therefore, proactively adapting devices to align with context fluctuations becomes a concern. To propose suitable configurations, it should be possible to sense information from devices, analyze the data and reconfigure them accordingly. Applied in the service of the environment, a fleet of devices can monitor environment indicators and control it in order to propose best fit solutions or prevent risks like over consumption of resources (e.g., water and energy). This paper describes our methodology in designing a framework for the monitoring and multi-instantiation of fleets of connected objects. First by identifying the particularities of the fleet, then by specifying connected object as a Dynamic Software Product Line (DSPL), capable of readjusting while running.",

However, context changes may affect system quality and therefore user satisfaction, hence mobile applications may greatly benefit from context awareness that allows the application to adapt to context changes. In this paper we propose a context aware approach for mobile applications that targets both software quality and user satisfaction. In particular, we focus on service availability and develop a methodology that, leveraging on a novel reward formula that contains the notion of software availability and users feedback, determines the best application adaptation to be applied in a given context. We show the devised methodology on a motivating example.",

      "Abstract": "Feature trees have been the standard data structure for representing product diversity in feature-based systems and software product line engineering (PLE). For basic product lines of modest size or complexity, one or several modular feature trees can be sufficient for managing the and resolving the variation present across the engineering assets in the systems engineering 'V' - from requirements, to design, through implementation, verification, validation, documentation, and more - in the software, mechanical, and electrical disciplines. However, enterprises seeking to adopt PLE at all levels of their organization, including areas such as product marketing, portfolio planning, manufacturing, supply chain, product sales, product service and maintenance, Internet-of-Things, resource planning, and much more are finding that thousands of nonengineering users need different views and interaction scenarios with a feature diversity representation. This paper describes a feature ontology (a specification of the meaning of terms in the feature modeling realm) that is suitable for managing the feature-based product line engineering and operations in the largest and most complex product line organizations. This ontology is based on layers of abstraction that each incrementally constrain the complexity and combinatorics and targets specific roles in the organization for greater degrees of efficiency, precision, and automation across an entire business enterprise.",

Examples of such limita-Tions are the exclusion of specific protocols, restrictions on the types of data that can be collected, requirements about what information can be transmitted to the public and controls around how that communication occurs. Capturing, representing and designing for these limitations as well as reuse is essential for the quick and successful deployment of such projects. In this paper, we present a case study of an IoT human in the loop monitoring system built for use within an industrial setting.

      "Abstract": "While maintaining core assets of a product line, product line engineers may need to adapt the assets to accommodate new requirements and new devices from the changing and newly emerging markets. Additionally, due to the emergence of new computing environments like autonomous systems (e.g., ubiquitous computing and the Internet of Things), there is increasing demand for dynamic adaptations of core assets, and this often needs to be managed with minimum human intervention.We propose an approach for managing a distributed feature model in order to facilitate the adaptation of self-adaptive dynamic software product lines (DSPLs). In addition, our approach allows the change of behaviours to promote the long lifecycle of self-adaptive DSPL. The case study applied in this paper is a baby care system (BCS). BCS assists people to monitor a baby while they are sleeping. We tested our BCS in the following scenarios: Adding features, removing features and changing behaviours. All these scenarios showed that it is possible to use our approach to self-adapt DSPLs.",

To reduce the energy consumption of an application the developer needs: (i) to identify what are the concerns that will impact more in the energy consumption; (ii) to model the variability of alternative designs and implementations of each concern; (iii) to store and compare the experimentation results related with the energy and time consumption of concerns; (iv) to find out what is the most eco-efficient solution for each concern. HADAS addresses these issues by modelling the variability of energy consuming concerns for different energy contexts. It connects the variability model with a repository that stores energy measurements, providing a Software Product Line (SPL) service, helping developers to reason and find out what are the most ecofriendly configurations. We have an initial implementation of the HADAS toolkit using Clafer. We have tested our implementation with several case studies.",

      "Abstract": "Nowadays, organizations are faced with the challenge of surviving in a highly flexible and competitive market. Especially the domain of Internet of Things is affected by short product cycles and high pricing pressure. Business Process oriented organizations have proven to perform better regarding highly flexible markets and fast production cycles. However, especially industries focused on low cost IoT systems are facing big problems if the according business processes are not aligned with the business processes. Consequently, a lot of development effort is spent for features which are never addressed by any business goal. With this work, we propose to use a combined variability management in order to efficiently address product variability on the organizational level as well as on the technical level.",

      "Abstract": "A Software Product Line (SPL) is a set of similar programs, called variants, with a common code base and well documented variability. Because the number of variants in an SPL can be large, checking them efficiently (e.g., to ensure that they are all well-typed) is a challenging problem. Delta-Oriented Programming (DOP) is a flexible approach to implement SPLs. The Abstract Behavioral Specification (ABS) modeling language and toolchain supports delta-oriented SPLs. In this paper we present an extension of the ABS toolchain with a mechanism for checking that all the variants of an SPL can be generated and are well-typed ABS programs. Currently we have implemented only part of this mechanism: our implementation (integrated in version 1.4.2 of the ABS toolchain and released in April 2017) checks whether all variants can be generated, however it does not check, in particular, whether the bodies of the methods are well-typed. Empirical evaluation shows that the current implementation allows for efficient partial type checking of existing ABS SPLs.",

      "Title": "System Product Line Engineering for Small Appliances with Driver Derivation",
      "Abstract": "Advances in device technology have promoted the development of small appliances such as wearable devices, IoT equipment, and small home electronics equipment. Considering a product family of such device/equipment, each product in the family may have different hardware (micro controller unit, devices such as sensors and actuators, and different configurations). Software for such equipment tends to be compact and handles the devices directly via drivers. However, software engineers are not familiar with driver development and this causes development bottleneck. Therefore, in order to develop products efficiently, derivations of software and hardware are not enough, i.e., the systematic derivation of drivers is indispensable. In this paper, we propose a system product line development method for small appliances in which drivers are systematically derived. In this method, hardware features and software features are managed in terms of feature models, and system products are derived by specifying features of hardware and software. Based on these, drivers are systematically derived. This paper proposes 1) an extension of the UML/MARTE model that can represent hardware information that is necessary for driver generation, and 2) a systematic driver derivation method based on variability management and model-driven engineering techniques. We evaluate the method using an example of a motion tracking system product family.",

The pervasivity of mobiles also enables the Mobile Crowd Sensing paradigm, which aims at using mobile-embedded sensors to ease the monitoring of multiple phenomena. The combination of these elements has recently converged into a new sensing model: Sensing as a Service (S2aaS), which is expected to offer novel monitoring approaches in the next years. In this paper, we propose a platform to pave the way for applying S2aaS in urban scenarios by considering both noise and electromagnetic field exposure. Design and implementation choices are discussed, along with privacy-related issues and preliminary monitoring tests conducted at a city in Southern Italy, in order to demonstrate the suitability of our approach.",

      "Title": "SeSaMe: Towards a Semantic Self Adaptive Middleware for Smart Spaces",
      "Abstract": "Smart spaces are inherently complex and dynamic systems, where diverse devices, sensors, actuators and computational elements need to interact with one another. A middleware infrastructure can provide suitable abstractions that simplify the task, and allow designers to ignore the details of the underlying elements. Unfortunately, however, existing middleware solutions do not generalize well to different kinds of spaces, since they often fail to address the scalability and dynamism of such spaces. In this paper we propose SeSaMe, a semantic and self-adaptive middleware infrastructure for highly dynamic and massive smart spaces. SeSaMe establishes a \"backbone\" to let components connect to the system without any prior knowledge of its topology. It is capable of maintaining the system's overall reliability, even when multiple components leave or fail unexpectedly, and of coping with message congestion, by dynamically altering the system's topology. SeSaMe also provides a simple declarative language for defining how one wants the system to evolve over time, and semantic technologies for harmonizing the interaction of different kinds of components. The main new features of SeSaMe are exemplified on two example smart spaces with significantly different characteristics. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",

The framework targets two types of users: the Software Product Line (SPL) designers and the end users. SPL designers use XANA's product line creation interface to create the software product line for end users. The product line creation interface allows SPL designers to capture the product line's feature model, the component design that implements each feature and the product line architecture. End users using XANA's application derivation interface select the features needed for their smart spaces and generate software applications from the product line previously created. In this paper we present the phases and operational semantics of XANA. We illustrate its use with a case study. The paper presents a preliminary user study that was conducted to assess the usability of the framework.",

      "Abstract": "The development of safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is expanding due to the Internet of Things' promise to make high-integrity applications and services part of everyday life. This expansion is seen in the dependencies some connected vehicles have on cloud services that provide guidance and accident avoidance / detection features. Such systems are safety-critical since failure could result in serious injury or death. Due to the severe consequences of failure, fault-tolerance, reliability and dependability should be primary driving qualities in the design and development of these systems. However, the cost of the analysis, evaluation and certification activities needed to ensure that the possibility of failure has been sufficiently mitigated is significantly higher than the cost of developing traditional software. Our group is exploring the addition of dynamic adaptive capabilities to safety-critical systems. We postulate that dynamic adaptivity could provide several enhancements to safety-critical systems. It would allow systems to reason about the environment within which they are sited and about their internal operation enabling decision making that is context-specific and appropriately prioritized. However, the addition of adaptivity with the associated overhead of reasoning is not without drawbacks particularly when hard real-time safety-critical systems are involved. In this brief position paper, we explore some of the questions and concerns that are raised when dynamic adaptive behavior is introduced into safety-critical systems as well as ways that the Architecture Analysis & Design Language (AADL) can be used to model / analyze such systems.",

First, it will identify the concept of mutual recognition through acquiring, describing and denoting the related domain knowledge. Then, it will divide the feature into three parts which are concept, attribute and the relation, and describe the feature from connotation and extension. It defines and normalizes feature in a clear way. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed modeling method will be verified through a ventilator embedded product line.",

Developing and deploying the data collection architectures of these systems is a challenging problem. The specificities of the sensor platforms compel software engineers to work at a low level. This makes this activity tedious, producing code that badly exploits the network architecture, and hampering reuse of data collection policies. Moreover, several data collection programs cannot be guaranteed to be deployable on a shared infrastructure. In this paper, we present an automated approach that supports (i) the definition of data collection policies at a higher level of abstraction, (ii) the representation of the diverse platforms and the network topology, and (iii) the automatic composition and deployment of the policies on top of heterogeneous sensing infrastructures following different strategies. The approach is tooled and has been assessed on both realistic and simulated deployments.",

While FMs define all possible configurations of the SPL, when considering dynamic SPLs not every possible configuration may be valid in all possible contexts. Unfortunately, common FMs can not capture this context dependence. In this paper, we remedy this problem by extending attributed FMs with Validity Formulas (VFs) that constrain the selection of a particular feature to a speci fic context and that are located directly within the FM. We provide a reconfiguration engine that checks if the active configuration is valid in the current context and, if not, computes how to reconfigure it. Furthermore, we present our implementation and demonstrate its feasibility within a case study derived from scenarios of our industry partner in the automotive domain.",

      "Abstract": "A key challenge posed by the Internet of Services is that applications need to cope with a continuously changing environment, both in terms of the context in which they operate and of the services, users and providers involved. Differently from applications where traditional change detection and adaptation mechanisms can be used, the Internet of Services requires systems that are adaptive by design. In this paper we present a design for adaptation framework supporting the modeling, development and operation of service based applications operating in highly dynamic environments. The approach exploits advanced techniques for dynamic and incremental service composition, allowing to effectively deal with changes occurring at different levels in the system. An implementation of the proposed solution is presented and evaluated on a real-world scenario from the Smart Urban Mobility domain.",

      "Title": "Combining variability, RCA and feature model for context-awareness",
      "Abstract": "As the notion of context-awareness evolves in different paradigms, the development of context-aware systems involves several processes. These processes include, inter alia, context modeling and reasoning as well as adaptation. In [1], we presented an approach that consists of context modeling and reasoning hand in hand based on relational concept analysis and descriptive logic, respectively. An essential aspect that is often neglected in context modeling and also triggers adaptation is the context variability. In this paper, we propose an approach that lies to answer this matter based on software product line. Our approach creates a semantic link between a context RCA-based model and a feature model, and uses the MAPE-K adaptation loop to determine the appropriate SPL configurations to deploy with regards to context changes. Thus, we used ontology to represent a combined context and feature model. Thereafter, the reasoning is done via descriptive logic. We also defined context rules based on SWRL and applied them to valid SPL configurations. Furthermore, we implemented the MAPE-K adaptation loop with Prolog.",

To stimulate innovation on their platforms, manufacturers of embedded products are creating software ecosystems that enable third-parties develop applications for their devices. Since such applications are developed externally, their seamless integration into the platforms is a challenge. In this paper, we propose to use semantic reasoning to select and configure applications in software ecosystems. Our prototype builds a model of the installation and the user goals through several steps. It processes application descriptions created by their developers and matches them to the installation model. Based on the matched descriptions, it presents options to deploy applications in the environment to the user sorted by their relevance. The proposed approach enables resolving complex requirements of applications before their installation in the platform. Our preliminary evaluation shows that the prototype supports the integration of the identified applications.",

Meanwhile, research in service ontology and service-oriented architecture is producing the much-needed technologies to link functional context of services with requirement features, and to automate the discovery and composition of services. This paper presents a novel approach of interactive requirements elicitation for the production of customized software systems. It first develops an ontology model to represent the knowledge of common and variable software assets, and then suggests a nine-step process to create instances of the ontology model as abstract requirement models for specific application domains. Moreover, an algorithm is developed to enable software clients to interactively order service-oriented software products by means of dialogue in natural language. In addition to technical details, this paper also includes a case study of an online book shopping system to demonstrate the operation of the proposed approach and to provide evidence of its usability.",

      "Abstract": "Energy-aware software is self-adaptive in nature which dynamically changes its behaviour to save energy. Context information plays a major role in developing such self-adaptive and energy-aware software. Any changes in context information may exhibit different number of operating conditions at run-time. The software should be efficiently developed to be more energy-efficient under different operating conditions through well defined dynamic adaptation policies. Developing such energy-aware adaptive behavior is a challenging task with current programming methods. We employed feature-oriented software development (FOSD) for developing such energy-aware self-adaptive software. In this paper, as first step, domain analysis framework for energy-aware self-adaptive software is proposed. The proposed framework uses feature models to explicitly specify the energy-aware features and context information. An illustrative example is presented to show the usefulness of the proposed domain analysis framework.",

Along with health-care and wellness, sports and recreational activities constitutes one of the most rapidly growing areas of personal and consumer-oriented Internet of Things technologies. This area of research is in its nascent stage of development and has been investigated by none till date. Though few companies have started working in this area, the methodology while manufacturing their products lack in standard architectural framework. Despite of huge market expectations, this filed of research lags far behind than other sectors of IoT. This literature investigates how sports and recreational activities can be augmented through novel services based on standard architecture of emerging IoT infrastructures. This paper envisages the Internet of Things for Sports (IoTSport) as the novel and state of the art framework which is capable to cater the needs of persuasion of current sports culture in a smart and handy way. Moreover, IoT for sports and recreational activities provide a new domain of research that includes several of the critical challenges which need to be taken care of. It is skeptical to the fact that the research output from this work would surely affect other domains such as health and rehabilitation in near future.",

With the basic idea (supported in e.g. OSGi) that components provide services, it makes it possible to smoothly integrate the Internet of Things (IoT) with the Internet of Services (IoS). The paradigm of the IoS indeed offers interesting capabilities in terms of dynamicity and interoperability. However in domains that involve \"things\" (e.g. appliances), there is still a strong need for loose coupling and a proper separation between types and instances that are well-known in Component-Based approaches but that typical SOA fail to provide. This paper presents how we can still get the best of both worlds by augmenting SOA with a Component-Based approach. We illustrate our approach with a case study from the domain of home automation. © 2010 IEEE.",

By integrating response time into reward calculation, a novel algorithm is created to direct conversation in different contextual control modes. The modes and their dynamic changes further provide hints to determine the emotion for the animation of agents' facial expressions and voice tunes. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method not only yields better performance for intention discovery, but also makes embodied conversational agents more appealing with emotion animation at run time. © 2013 IEEE.",

      "Abstract": "The development of context-Aware applications is a complex process that involves context management. A context life cycle implies 4 essential steps: context acquisition, context modeling, context reasoning and context dissemination [1]. In [2], we tackled the issue of context modeling and reasoning by proposing an approach based on Relational Concept Analysis (RCA) and Descriptive Logic (DL), respectively. A main aspect that is neglected in context model is the context variability, which we refer to it as a range or set of context values of an environment along which that environment changes. Context variability can benefit from software product lines [3]. For this reason, this paper proposes an approach describing the relationship between a context RCA-based model and a feature model in order to describe the variability of contexts in which software of a software product line is used. Thus, we represent a feature model as ontology to obtain a semantic model. We also define context rules derived from the context model and based on SWRL that we apply to SPL configurations. We explain the inferred reasoning justifications obtained from a reasoner and detail the implementation of our proposed approach.",

We present the implications on the architecture of the ecosystem and the concepts defined in the model. Finally, we discuss the evaluation of the model and its benefits and liabilities.

In this paper, we propose a multi-tenancy meta-model framework, designed to support different services for multiple tenants. We also present an ontology model, based on our meta-model, with its interchange methods between the two model types. We also describe the framework for our prototype through two scenarios that illustrate the meta-model feasibility. We explain the realizability of our approaches by adding individual RDF(Resource Description Framework) examples that come from the two scenarios.",

      "Abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) is the concept of connecting multiple objects together in an Internet-based architecture. Applications built around this concept are constantly growing in variety and quantity. Technologies in IoT have been evolving rapidly and the alternatives also have increased quickly. As a result, it becomes challenging to conduct system and software trade-off analysis or select suitable IoT technologies for applications. The paper emphasizes variability management (consisting of alternative technologies) and aims to provide a framework as a result, which would allow or facilitate users to create their own IoT applications. In order to achieve this goal, we have adopted the idea of software product line engineering (SPLE) and created a framework with a layered architecture consisting of a Cloud Layer, a Central Hub Layer, and an End Devices Layer. The layers are loosely coupled with well-defined interfaces allowing for variability to be added at each layer. We were successfully able to create a framework which allows users to build their own applications, only being limited by the devices supported by the framework.",

      "Abstract": "Information and communication technology today is increasingly integrated into the environment we live in, distributed on cars, appliances and smart infrastructures. The software running on these devices is increasingly individualized, adapted to the preferences and needs of the specific customer and must be able to evolve after deployment by means of software patches. Upgrades are becoming individualized; software patches used to upgrade the software are selected and adapted depending on the configuration and external constraints of the host device. The objective of the European project HyVar is to develop techniques and tools for fast and customizable software design, for the management of highly distributed applications, for continuous software evolution of remote devices, and scalable infrastructure to accommodate a large number of devices. The track Variability Modeling for Scalable Software Evolution aims to foster cooperation opportunities and create synergies between related research directions to address challenges stemming from software variability, evolution, and cloud technology for highly distributed applications in heterogeneous environments. This paper introduces the track and its individual contributions.",

      "Abstract": "In the context of the Internet of Things, sensors are surrounding our environment. These small pieces of electronics are inserted in everyday life's elements (e.g., cars, doors, radiators, smartphones) and continuously collect information about their environment. One of the biggest challenges is to support the development of accurate monitoring dashboard to visualise such data. The one-size-fits-all paradigm does not apply in this context, as user's roles are variable and impact the way data should be visualised: a building manager does not need to work on the same data as classical users. This paper presents an approach based on model composition techniques to support the development of such monitoring dashboards, taking into account the domain variability. This variability is supported at both implementation and modelling levels. The results are validated on a case study named SmartCampus, involving sensors deployed in a real academic campus. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",

The Internet of Things refers to the future internet which will contain trillions of nodes representing various objects from small ubiquitous sensor devices and handhelds to large web servers and supercomputer clusters. The workshop investigated a number of areas appertaining to data management in the Internet of Things from storage structures, through database management methods, to service-oriented architectures and new approaches to information search. Running orthogonal to these layers the matter of security was also considered. Taking a philosophical viewpoint our whole current framework for understanding data management may be ill-equipped to meet the challenges of the Internet of Things.

      "Abstract": "One of the most important challenges of this decade is the Internet of Things (IoT) or the integration of devices from the real world in the Internet. IoT systems are usually composed of heterogenous and interconnected lightweight devices that support applications that are subject to change in their external environment and in the functioning of these devices. The management of the variability of these changes, autonomously, is a challenge in the development of these systems. Agents are a good option to develop IoT systems due to their distributed nature, context-awareness and self-adaptation. Our goal is to enhance the development of IoT applications using agents and advanced software techniques like Variability Modeling. Specifically, we propose to use Self-StarMAS agents and CVL. In this contribution, we propose a CVL process for the development of Self-StarMAS agents.",

      "Abstract": "One of the most important challenges of this decade is the Internet of Things (IoT) that pursues the integration of real-world objects in the virtual world of the Internet. One property that characterises IoT systems is that they have to react to variable and continuous changes. This means that IoT systems need to work as self-managed systems to effectively manage context changes. The autonomy property inherent to software agents makes them a suitable choice for developing self-managed IoT systems. By embedding agents in the devices that compose the IoT is possible to realize a decentralized system with selfmanagement capacities. However, in this scenario new problems arise. Firstly, current agent development approaches lack mechanisms to deal with the heterogeneity present in the IoT domain. Secondly, agents must simultaneously deal with potentially conflicting changes in their behaviour, concerning self-management and application goals. In order to afford these challenges we propose to use an approach based on Dynamic Software Product Lines (D-SPL) and preference-based reasoning. The D-SPL provides to the preference-based reasoning of the agent with the necessary information to adapt its behaviour at runtime making a tradeoff between the self-management of the system and the accomplishment of its application goals.",

      "Abstract": "One of the most important challenges of this decade is the Internet of Things (IoT) that pursues the integration of real-world objects in Internet. One of the key areas of the IoT is the Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems, which should be able to react to variable and continuous changes while ensuring their acceptance and adoption by users. This means that AAL systems need to work as self-adaptive systems. The autonomy property inherent to software agents, makes them a suitable choice for developing self-adaptive systems. However, agents lack the mechanisms to deal with the variability present in the IoT domain with regard to devices and network technologies. To overcome this limitation we have already proposed a Software Product Line (SPL) process for the development of self-adaptive agents in the IoT. Here we analyze the challenges that poses the development of self-adaptive AAL systems based on agents. To do so, we focus on the domain and application engineering of the self-adaptation concern of our SPL process. In addition, we provide a validation of our development process for AAL systems.",

      "Abstract": "Smart farming adopts advanced technology and the corresponding principles to increase the amount of production and economic returns, often also with the goal to reduce the impact on the environment. One of the key elements of smart farming is the farm management information systems (FMISs) that supports the automation of data acquisition and processing, monitoring, planning, decision making, documenting, and managing the farm operations. An increased number of FMISs now adopt internet of things (IoT) technology to further optimize the targeted business goals. Obviously IoT systems in agriculture typically have different functional and quality requirements such as choice of communication protocols, the data processing capacity, the security level, safety level, and time performance. For developing an IoT-based FMIS, it is important to design the proper architecture that meets the corresponding requirements. To guide the architect in designing the IoT based farm management information system that meets the business objectives a systematic approach is provided. To this end a design-driven research approach is adopted in which feature-driven domain analysis is used to model the various smart farming requirements. Further, based on a FMIS and IoT reference architectures the steps and the modeling approaches for designing IoT-based FMIS architectures are described. The approach is illustrated using two case studies on smart farming in Turkey, one for smart wheat production in Konya, and the other for smart green houses in Antalya.",

When sensors that are members of multiple IoT gateways can inter-operate at the same time for more than one application, it will reduce cost to deploy IoT infrastructure. However, reliability has also developed as the most important aspect for real-time data collection that should be streamed constantly. Due to uncertainty factors sensors failure is potentially occurred, then an adaptive approach should be addressed into this as to guarantee the flow of streaming data. This paper proposed an adaptive sensor-cloud mechanism to manage the reliability by using a runtime model approach where a transition model and dynamic software product line engineering will take place to weaving the system. Our technique is comparable to other approaches and can be implemented in many types of Cloud-based services.",

      "Abstract": "For the last two decades the Internet of Things (IoT) has been a subject of growing global interest. Particularly dynamic industries such as the healthcare service sector have just begun to understand the benefits of the IoT for the provision of a new, more advanced type of services. However, whilst the healthcare service industry is yet to fully grasp the benefits of information systems for its practitioners and managers, and for patients and families, there is a need for a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated to IoT-based healthcare systems as another disruptive wave of technologies. In particular, research on the relevance of users’ skills for adoption of IoT-based healthcare services has been limited. Using the current Internet-based healthcare service landscape as a platform for the formulation and testing of its hypotheses, this paper explores the relationship between patients’ capabilities for effective use of information and communication technologies and the success of IoT-based healthcare services. The resulting theoretical model for effective use of information and communication technologies and the success of IoT-based healthcare services was then validated. The validation was based on data collected from a randomly selected sample of 256 users of Internet-based healthcare services provided by the public healthcare system of the Region of Murcia in Spain. The findings of this research inform future strategies for the implementation of new generations of health and well-being services based on IoT technologies.",

      "Abstract": "The large number of published services has motivated the development of tools for creating customized composite services known as service compositions. While service compositions provide high agility and development flexibility, they can also pose challenges when it comes to delivering guaranteed functional and non-functional requirements. This is primarily due to the highly dynamic environment in which services operate. In this paper, we propose adaptation mechanisms that are able to effectively maintain functional and non-functional quality requirements in service compositions derived from software product lines. Unlike many existing work, the proposed adaptation mechanism does not require explicit user-defined adaptation strategies. We adopt concepts from the software product line engineering paradigm where service compositions are viewed as a collection of features and adaptation happens through product line reconfiguration. We have practically implemented the proposed mechanism in ourMagus tool suite and performed extensive experiments, which show that our work is both practical and efficient for automatically adapting service compositions once violations of functional or non-functional requirements are observed.",

      "Abstract": "The impact of energy consumption on the environment and the economy is raising awareness of “green” software engineering. HADAS is an eco-assistant that makes developers aware of the influence of their designs and implementations on the energy consumption and performance of the final product. In this paper, we extend HADAS to better support the requirements of users: researchers, automatically dumping the energy-consumption of different software solutions; and developers, who want to perform a sustainability analysis of different software solutions. This analysis has been extended by adding Pearson’s chi-squared differentials and Bootstrapping statistics, to automatically check the significance of correlations of the energy consumption, or the execution time, with any other variable (e.g., the number of users) that can influence the selection of a particular eco-efficient configuration. We have evaluated our approach by performing a sustainability analysis of the most common web servers (i.e. PHP servers) using the time and energy data measured with the Watts Up? Pro tool previously dumped in HADAS. We show how HADAS helps web server providers to make a trade-off between energy consumption and execution time, allowing them to sell different server configurations with different costs without modifying the hardware.",

      "Title": "Energy-aware environments for the development of green applications for cyber–physical systems",
      "Abstract": "Cyber–physical Systems are usually composed by a myriad of battery-powered devices. Therefore, developers should pay attention to the energy consumption of the global system so as not to compromise the system lifetime. There are plenty of experimental studies that give hints about how to reduce the energy consumption. However, this knowledge is not readily available for the software developers of cyber–physical systems. They normally use software development environments that do not provide useful advice about the energy consumption of the software solutions being implemented. In this paper, we propose a Developer Eco-Assistant to integrate the experimental results obtained by researchers into the software development environments, so as to increase the energy-awareness of cyber–physical systems developers. In our solution, the energy information is obtained in real-time from a repository of energy consuming concerns, where researchers store their experimental measurements. Developers use the repository to perform sustainability analyses, which, in turn, will lead to greener design/implementation decisions. In this paper, we illustrate the use of our approach in the context of cyber–physical systems development using both open source environments (e.g. JetBrains IDEs) and proprietary environments (e.g. Waspmote development environment). We experimentally demonstrate that cyber–physical systems can reduce more than 40% of its energy consumption depending on the scenario, reaching approximately 90% in some certain cases.",

      "Abstract": "A software product line is used for the development of a family of products utilizing the reusability of existing resources with low costs and time to market. Feature Model (FM) is used extensively to manage the common and variable features of a family of products, such as Internet of Things (IoT) applications. In the literature, the binary pattern for nested cardinality constraints (BPNCC) approach has been proposed to compute all possible combinations of development features for IoT applications without violating any relationship constraints. Relationship constraints are a predefined set of rules for the selection of features from an FM. Due to high probability of relationship constraints violations, obtaining optimum features combinations from large IoT-based FMs are a challenging task. Therefore, in order to obtain optimum solutions, in this paper, we have proposed multi-objective optimum-BPNCC that consists of three independent paths (first, second, and third). Furthermore, we applied heuristics on these paths and found that the first path is infeasible due to space and execution time complexity. The second path reduces the space complexity; however, time complexity increases due to the increasing group of features. Among these paths, the performance of the third path is best as it removes optional features that are not required for optimization. In experiments, we calculated the outcomes of all three paths that show the significant improvement of optimum solution without constraint violation occurrence. We theoretically prove that this paper is better than previously proposed optimization algorithms, such as a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm and an indicator-based evolutionary algorithm.",

      "Abstract": "The current Internet-of-things (IoT) hype, pushed by the unprecedented rate of the technological enablers’ innovation, is threatening to leave behind some major, not so obvious, unresolved issues. IoT platforms will extend existing enterprise information systems (EIS) infrastructures to encompass cross-domain sensing and actuating capabilities, thus introducing additional complexity and major risks to the implementation. Furthermore, IoT platforms are typically driven by models of the trivial complexity; they support very simple data structures and almost no business logic implementation. Finally, IoT systems are today managed centrally, which often means less openness, less flexibility and greater change management costs. In this article, we provide the overview of the scientific disciplines which could contribute to the resolution of the IoT implementation problem, namely requirements engineering, change management/continuous improvement, model-based systems engineering, system architecture design, interoperability and policy and regulatory aspects. Then, we identify the challenges of these contributions in the context of IoT and finally make an attempt to identify research directions which could have a significant impact. The discussion of the challenges and opportunities is illustrated by the proposed domain framework for implementation of open IoT ecosystems.",

The review covered 238 journal papers from five digital libraries. The 55 papers that met the review inclusion criteria focused on 22 NFRs, each describing a unique system behavior quality. The most dominant of these NFRs were interoperability,usability,performance,security, privacy, safety, and accuracy. A noticeable NFR gap is the notion of caring. It is not readily apparent how a medical device that monitors a patient or delivers medications or anesthetics can “care about” the sufferings, feelings and emotional needs of a patient; however, in the healthcare arena these are valid concerns. A second theme found in the papers reviewed focused on software standards/process improvement when developing software intensive medical devices. This research also provides an analysis of the software architecture tactics those researchers utilized to implement the NFRs in the medical devices.",

      "Title": "Building reliable and maintainable Dynamic Software Product Lines: An investigation in the Body Sensor Network domain",
      "Abstract": "Context: Dependability is a key requirement, especially in safety-critical applications. Many of these applications have changing context and configurations at runtime to achieve functional and quality goals and can be realized as Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs). DSPL constitutes an emerging but promising research area. Nevertheless, ensuring dependability in DSPLs remains insufficiently explored, especially in terms of reliability and maintainability. This compromises quality assurance and applicability of DSPLs in safety-critical domains, such as Body Sensor Network (BSN). Objective: To address this issue, we propose an approach to developing reliable and maintainable DSPLs in the context of the BSN domain. Method: Adaptation plans are instances of a Domain Specific Language (DSL) describing reliability goals and adaptability at runtime. These instances are automatically checked for reliability goal satisfiability before being deployed and interpreted at runtime to provide more suitable adaptation goals complying with evolving needs perceived by a domain specialist. Results: The approach is evaluated in the BSN domain. Results show that reliability and maintainability could be provided with execution and reconfiguration times of around 30 ms, notification and adaptation plan update time over the network around 5 s, and space consumption around 5 MB. Conclusion: The method is feasible at reasonable cost. The incurred benefits are reliable vital signal monitoring for the patient—thus providing early detection of serious health issues and the possibility of proactive treatment—and a maintainable infrastructure allowing medical DSL instance update to suit the needs of the domain specialist and ultimately of the patient.",

      "Abstract": "Whilst researchers and professionals recognise that mobile health (M-health) systems offer unprecedented opportunities, most existing work has comprised individual project-based developments in specialised areas. Existing review articles generally utilise medical literature and categories: none investigates M-health from an information systems (IS) design point of view. Identifying application areas, design issues and IS research techniques will demonstrate models, issues, approaches and gaps to inform future research. A comprehensive analysis of the literature from this viewpoint is thus valuable, both for theoretical progression and for guiding real-world innovative system developments. Drawing from key IS and healthcare multidisciplinary journals we analyse recent (2010–2016) articles concerning M-health application developments and their associated design or development issues, with particular focus on the use of contemporary research methods. Our analysis suggests that M-health is an emerging field to which, although underused, contemporary approaches such as design science research are particularly appropriate. We identify eight application categories, eleven design issues (security, privacy, literacy, accessibility, acceptability, reliability, usability, confidentiality, integrity, knowledge sharing and flexibility) as well as the stakeholders and development techniques involved. This goes beyond previous frameworks, and theoretically integrates the central role of IS design within the sub-field.",

      "Abstract": "The automotive domain is living an extremely challenging historical moment shocked by many emerging business and technological needs. Electrification, autonomous driving, and connected cars are some of the driving needs in this changing world. Increasingly, vehicles are becoming software-intensive complex systems and most of the innovation within the automotive industry is based on electronics and software. Modern vehicles can have over 100 Electronic Control Units (ECUs), which are small computers, together executing gigabytes of software. ECUs are connected to each other through several networks within the car, and the car is increasingly connected with the outside world. These novelties ask for a change on how the software is engineered and produced and for a disruptive renovation of the electrical and software architecture of the car. In this paper we describe the current investigation of Volvo Cars to create an architecture framework able to cope with the complexity and needs of present and future vehicles. Specifically, we present scenarios that describe demands for the architectural framework and introduce three new viewpoints that need to be taken into account for future architectural decisions: Continuous Integration and Deployment, Ecosystem and Transparency, and car as a constituent of a System of Systems. Our results are based on a series of focus groups with experts in automotive engineering and architecture from different companies and universities.",

      "Abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) can be used anywhere, anytime and with any device. IoT devices are used broadly in recent industry such as health care, transport, education and communication channels. IoT applications make enable the use of IoT systems in different environment such as heat sensor functionality varies for indoor and outdoor, water sensors in automobile for screen viper movement (auto working during rain and stop if there is no raining), heartbeat sensors for old and young patients. Moreover, IoT devices are same but the operating functionality is different according to environment and end user’s perspective. Therefore, this kind of variability management is very important for reusability of resources in multiple environments. However, variability management is difficult task due to the dependency of resources, relationships between them and compatibility issues. Feature Modeling of Software Product Line (SPL) is extensively used to manage the variability management for family of software that share common resources and varies in different points. In this paper we have proposed simple and effective approach for variability management of IoT-based applications by using feature modeling. We have proposed XML-based feature modeling for IoT-based applications for variability management and increase the reusability of existing resources. Our approach defines the complete package from domain modeling to application development by using XML-schema and XSLT files to select and deselect the features for final application development. Our final architecture of IoT-based feature model shows the complete relationships and include exclude associations between them without any constraint violations.",

A local context model tailored to the specific needs of a particular application is defined as a view over the global context in the form of a feature model. Feature models and their configurations derived from the global context state are then used by a specific dynamic software product line in order to adapt applications at runtime. The main focus of the paper is on the realization of mappings between global and local contexts.

This system is currently deployed in the Museum of Informatics at the Informatics School of the University of Màlaga, and its main contributions are: (i) a mobile application that provides management facilities to museum staff by means of sensing and processing environmental data; (ii) providing an integrated solution for visitors, tour guides and museum staff that allows coordination and communication enrichment among different groups of users; (iii) using and benefiting from group communication for heterogeneous groups of users that can be created on demand.",

      "Abstract": "Complexity of Internet of Things (IoT) applications and difficulty to predict their behaviour in wireless communications make modelling of IoT units an important research topic. The IoT unit is considered here as the two-node IoT model that supports bi-directional wireless communications. There are many approaches to model security and energy awareness; however, little is known about the synergistic effect of those factors at the application level under the influence of environmental factors such as noise. The paper introduces a modelling framework to model the security-energy-environment issues as main attributes to allow defining quality of service (QoS) for the IoT-based applications. Among others, the healthcare ones are regarded as predominant now. We model IoT units using the feature-based modelling methodology adopted from the software engineering domain. The result of modelling is a set of feature models with valid configurations that describe the energy-security-environment-performance relationships and possible constraints to support various IoT applications. Having feature models, we can select a configuration that is best suited for a given IoT application with respect to QoS requirements. As feature models represent abstract relationships of domain factors, we need additionally to provide experiments to determine concrete values of modelled features. We describe the experimental system to measure energy consumption under the influencing factors. Both models (abstract and concrete) allow reasoning about QoS of the IoT applications.

      "Abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is the main driver for industrial smart products produced by an increasing number of manufacturers. The overall functionality of smart products is a combination of mechanical, electrical/electronic functions (hardware functions) and software functions. For hardware and software there are different lifecycle models: Product lifecycle management (PLM) focuses on hardware, application lifecycle management (ALM) focuses on software. Smart products force manufacturers to converge both lifecycle models step by step. Although seemingly important, the research community leaves this innovative area mostly up to the PLM tool vendors and the ALM tool vendors, resulting in them driving the convergence. This paper points out the mismatch between industry and academia regarding the PLM/ALM convergence. We encourage academia to increase research activities and we propose potential research topics.",

      "Title": "Systematic scalability assessment for feature oriented multi-tenant services",
      "Abstract": "Recent software engineering paradigms such as software product lines, supporting development techniques like feature modeling, and cloud provisioning models such as platform and infrastructure as a service, allow for great flexibility during both software design and deployment, resulting in potentially large cost savings. However, all this flexibility comes with a catch: as the combinatorial complexity of optional design features and deployment variability increases, the difficulty of assessing system qualities such as scalability and quality of service increases too. And if the software itself is not scalable (for instance, because of a specific set of selected features), deploying additional service instances is a futile endeavor. Clearly there is a need to systematically measure the impact of feature selection on scalability, as the potential cost savings can be completely mitigated by the risk of having a system that is unable to meet service demand. In this work, we document our results on systematic load testing for automated quality of service and scalability analysis. The major contribution of our work is tool support and a methodology to analyze the scalability of these distributed, feature oriented multi-tenant software systems in a continuous integration process. We discuss our approach to select features for load testing such that a representative set of feature combinations is used to elicit valuable information on the performance impact and feature interactions. Additionally, we highlight how our methodology and framework for performance and scalability prediction differs from state-of-practice solutions. We take the viewpoint of both the tenant of the service and the service provider, and report on our experiences applying the approach to an industrial use case in the domain of electronic payments. We conclude that the integration of systematic scalability tests in a continuous integration process offers strong advantages to software developers and service providers, such as the ability to quantify the impact of new features in existing service compositions, and the early detection of hidden feature interactions that may negatively affect the overall performance of multi-tenant services.",

We use feature models to represent the requirements at the earliest stage for the analysis and describe a model-driven methodology to design the possible BAN applications. Firstly, we specify the requirements as the problem domain (PD) variability model for the BAN applications. Next, we introduce the generative technology (meta-programming as the solution domain (SD)) and the mapping procedure to map the PD feature-based variability model onto the SD feature model. Finally, we create an executable meta-specification that represents the BAN functionality to describe the variability of the problem domain though transformations. The meta-specification (along with the meta-language processor) is a software generator for multiple BAN-oriented applications. We validate the methodology with experiments and a case study to generate a family of programs for the BAN sensor controllers. This enables to obtain the adequate measure of QoS efficiently through the interactive adjustment of the meta-parameter values and re-generation process for the concrete BAN application.",

      "Abstract": "Increasingly, mobile devices play a key role in the communication between users and the services embedded in their environment. With ever greater number of services added to our surroundings, there is a need to personalize services according to the user needs and environmental context avoiding service behavior from becoming overwhelming. In order to prevent this information overload, we present a method for the development of mobile services that can be personalized in terms of obtrusiveness (the degree in which each service intrudes the user's mind) according to the user needs and preferences. That is, services can be developed to provide their functionality at different obtrusiveness levels depending on the user by minimizing the duplication of efforts. On the one hand, we provide mechanisms for describing the obtrusiveness degree required for a service. On the other hand, we make use of Feature Modeling techniques in order to define the obtrusiveness level adaptation in a declarative manner. An experiment was conducted in order to put in practice the proposal and evaluate the user acceptance for the personalization capabilities provided by our approach. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2011.",

Objective: To identify, evaluate, and synthesize research about the most relevant approaches addressing the different phases of the software development life cycle for ubiquitous systems. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review of papers presenting and evaluating approaches for the different phases of the software development life cycle for ubiquitous systems. Approaches were classified according to the phase of the development cycle they addressed, identifying their main concerns and limitations. Results: We identified 128 papers reporting 132 approaches addressing issues related to different phases of the software development cycle for ubiquitous systems. Most approaches have been aimed at addressing the implementation, evolution/maintenance, and feedback phases, while others phases such as testing need more attention from researchers. Conclusion: We recommend to follow existing guidelines when conducting case studies to make the studies more reproducible and closer to real life cases. While some phases of the development cycle have been extensively explored, there is still room for research in other phases, toward a more agile and integrated cycle, from requirements to testing and feedback.",

Due to new computing trends, such as pervasive computing, miniaturization of IT leads to mobile devices with the emerging need for context adaptation. Therefore, it is beneficial that devices are able to adapt context. Hence, we propose to extend the definition of SASs and include context adaptation. This paper presents a taxonomy of self-adaptation and a survey on engineering SASs. Based on the taxonomy and the survey, we motivate a new perspective on SAS including context adaptation.",

      "Title": "Architectural evolution of FamiWare using cardinality-based feature models",
      "Abstract": "Context: Ambient Intelligence systems domain is an outstanding example of modern systems that are in permanent evolution, as new devices, technologies or facilities are continuously appearing. This means it would be desirable to have a mechanism that helps with the propagation of evolution changes in deployed systems. Objective: We present a software product line engineering process to manage the evolution of FamiWare, a family of middleware for ambient intelligence environments. This process drives the evolution of FamiWare middleware configurations using cardinality-based feature models, which are especially well suited to express the structural variability of ambient intelligence systems. Method: FamiWare uses cardinality-based feature models and clonable features to model the structural variability present in ambient intelligence systems, composed of a large variety of heterogeneous devices. Since the management evolution of configurations with clonable features is manually untreatable due to the high number of features, our process automates it and propagates changes made at feature level to the architectural components of the FamiWare middleware. This is a model driven development process as the evolution management, the propagation of evolution changes and the code generation are performed using some kind of model mappings and transformations. Concretely we present a variability modelling language to map the selection of features to the corresponding FamiWare middleware architectural components. Results: Our process is able to manage the evolution of cardinality-based feature models with thousands of features, something which is not possible to tackle manually. Thanks to the use of the variability language and the automatic code generation it is possible to propagate and maintain a correspondence between the FamiWare architectural model and the code. The process is then able to calculate the architectural differences between the evolved configuration and the previous one. Checking these differences, our process helps to calculate the effort needed to perform the evolution changes in the customized products. To perform those tasks we have defined two operators, one to calculate the differences between two feature model configurations and another to create a new configuration from a previous one. Conclusion: Our process automatically propagates the evolution changes of the middleware family into the existing configurations where the middleware is already deployed and also helps us to calculate the effort in performing the changes in every configuration. Finally, we validated our approach, demonstrating the functioning of the defined operators and showing that by using our tool we can generate evolved configurations for FamiWare with thousands of cloned features, for several case studies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

      "Title": "An approach based on the domain perspective to develop WSAN applications",
      "Abstract": "As wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs) can be used in many different domains, WSAN applications have to be built from two viewpoints: domain and network. These different viewpoints create a gap between the abstractions handled by the application developers, namely the domain and network experts. Furthermore, there is a coupling between the application logic and the underlying sensor platform, which results in platform-dependent projects and source codes difficult to maintain, modify, and reuse. Consequently, the process of developing an application becomes cumbersome. In this paper, we propose a model-driven architecture (MDA) approach for WSAN application development. Our approach aims to facilitate the task of the developers by: (1) enabling application design through high abstraction level models; (2) providing a specific methodology for developing WSAN applications; and (3) offering an MDA infrastructure composed of PIM, PSM, and transformation programs to support this process. Our approach allows the direct contribution of domain experts in the development of WSAN applications, without requiring specific knowledge of programming WSAN platforms. In addition, it allows network experts to focus on the specific characteristics of their area of expertise without the need of knowing each specific application domain.",

      "Title": "A Model-Driven Framework to Develop Personalized Health Monitoring",
      "Abstract": "Both distributed healthcare systems and the Internet of Things (IoT) are currently hot topics. The latter is a new computing paradigm to enable advanced capabilities in engineering various applications, including those for healthcare. For such systems, the core social requirement is the privacy/security of the patient information along with the technical requirements (e.g., energy consumption) and capabilities for adaptability and personalization. Typically, the functionality of the systems is predefined by the patient's data collected using sensor networks along with medical instrumentation; then, the data is transferred through the Internet for treatment and decision-making. Therefore, systems creation is indeed challenging. In this paper, we propose a model-driven framework to develop the IoT-based prototype and its reference architecture for personalized health monitoring (PHM) applications. The framework contains a multi-layered structure with feature-based modeling and feature model transformations at the top and the application software generation at the bottom. We have validated the framework using available tools and developed an experimental PHM to test some aspects of the functionality of the reference architecture in real time. The main contribution of the paper is the development of the model-driven computational framework with emphasis on the synergistic effect of security and energy issues.",

      "Abstract": "Smart farming is a management style that includes smart monitoring, planning and control of agricultural processes. This management style requires the use of a wide variety of software and hardware systems from multiple vendors. Adoption of smart farming is hampered because of a poor interoperability and data exchange between ICT components hindering integration. Software Ecosystems is a recent emerging concept in software engineering that addresses these integration challenges. Currently, several Software Ecosystems for farming are emerging. To guide and accelerate these developments, this paper provides a reference architecture for Farm Software Ecosystems. This reference architecture should be used to map, assess design and implement Farm Software Ecosystems. A key feature of this architecture is a particular configuration approach to connect ICT components developed by multiple vendors in a meaningful, feasible and coherent way. The reference architecture is evaluated by verification of the design with the requirements and by mapping two existing Farm Software Ecosystems using the Farm Software Ecosystem Reference Architecture. This mapping showed that the reference architecture provides insight into Farm Software Ecosystems as it can describe similarities and differences. A main conclusion is that the two existing Farm Software Ecosystems can improve configuration of different ICT components. Future research is needed to enhance configuration in Farm Software Ecosystems.",

      "Abstract": "In Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and even in the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, the reconfiguration of sensor variables is an important problem when the role of a system (or application) program’s sensor nodes needs to be adjusted in a particular situation. For example, the outdoor temperature in a volcanic zone, which is usually updated in a system every 10 s, should be updated every 1 s during an emergency situation. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel approach based on changing only a set of sensor variables in a part of a program, rather than modifying the entire program, in order to reduce both network congestion and the sensor nodes’ battery consumption. To validate our approach, we demonstrate an implementation of a proof-of-concept prototype system and also present results of comparative studies showing the performance and effectiveness of our proposed method.",

      "Abstract": "The Internet of Things is the natural continuity of the Ambient Intelligence where smart and ambient environments are built mainly by integrating a large number of interconnected smart objects (sensors, actuators, Smartphone, appliances, etc.) with heterogeneous capabilities abstracted as software services. These services can be composed on the fly and provided, all the time and everywhere, to assist users in their daily activities. A key issue in user-centered services composition is to intelligently and effectively discover and select the most relevant services that best match the users' requirements and closely meet the specified quality-of-service level. Monitoring seamlessly the provided services and enhancing their quality, is still a challenging issue due mainly to the dynamicity and uncertainty characterizing ambient environments. In this paper, we propose a new service-oriented, user-centered and event-aware Framework capable of performing services monitoring to handle automatically events that may occur in ambient environments. This monitoring is based on a dynamic services discovery and selection process to enhance self-adaptation to unpredicted changes, and ensure services continuity with best quality. The overall proposed Framework has been implemented and validated through a scenario dedicated to daily activity recognition in an Ambient-Assisted Living environment. In addition, the obtained performances from extensive tests show clearly the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed approach in the case of a large-scale environment.",

      "Abstract": "Independent living of senior citizens is one of the main challenges linked to the ageing population. Senior citizens may suffer from a number of diseases, including the decline in cardiopulmonary conditions, weaker muscle functions and a declined neuromuscular control of the movements, which result in a higher risk of fall and a higher vulnerability for cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. With respect to cognitive functions, senior citizens may suffer from a decline of memory function, less ability to orientate and a declined ability to cope with complex situations. This is by itself a big societal challenge with impact in multiple sectors. In this paper we present an innovative ICT solution, named eWALL, that aims to address these challenges by means of an advanced ICT infrastructure and home sensing environment; thus differentiating from existing eHealth and eCare solutions. The system of eWALL will extend the state-of-the-art of Assistive Platforms and will significantly increase the independent living of seniors.",

      "Title": "Binary Pattern for Nested Cardinality Constraints for Software Product Line of IoT-Based Feature Models",
      "Abstract": "Software product line (SPL) is extensively used for reusability of resources in family of products. Feature modeling is an important technique used to manage common and variable features of SPL in applications, such as Internet of Things (IoT). In order to adopt SPL for application development, organizations require information, such as cost, scope, complexity, number of features, total number of products, and combination of features for each product to start the application development. Application development of IoT is varied in different contexts, such as heat sensor indoor and outdoor environment. Variability management of IoT applications enables to find the cost, scope, and complexity. All possible combinations of features make it easy to find the cost of individual application. However, exact number of all possible products and features combination for each product is more valuable information for an organization to adopt product line. In this paper, we have proposed binary pattern for nested cardinality constraints (BPNCC), which is simple and effective approach to calculate the exact number of products with complex relationships between application's feature models. Furthermore, BPNCC approach identifies the feasible features combinations of each IoT application by tracing the constraint relationship from top-to-bottom. BPNCC is an open source and tool-independent approach that does not hide the internal information of selected and non-selected IoT features. The proposed method is validated by implementing it on small and large IoT application feature models with 'n' number of constraints, and it is found that the total number of products and all features combinations in each product without any constraint violation.",

      "Abstract": "One of the most important challenges of this decade is the Internet of Things (IoT), which aims to enable things to be connected anytime, anyplace, with anything and anyone, ideally using any path/network and any service. IoT systems are usually composed of heterogeneous and interconnected lightweight devices that support applications that are subject to change in their external environment and in the functioning of these devices. The management of the variability of these changes, autonomously, is a challenge in the development of these systems. Agents are a good option for developing self-managed IoT systems due to their distributed nature, context-awareness and self-adaptation. Our goal is to enhance the development of IoT applications using agents and software product lines (SPL). Specifically, we propose to use Self-StarMASMAS, multi-agent system) agents and to define an SPL process using the Common Variability Language. In this contribution, we propose an SPL process for Self-StarMAS, paying particular attention to agents embedded in sensor motes.",

      "Abstract": "Smart City Application Engineering is a challenging task due to the constantly evolving environment in which these applications operate and the variability of the different types of technologies that synthesize them. Therefore, flexibility and extendibility are two important quality attributes that should be taken into consideration when designing Smart City Applications. In this paper, we propose the Smart City Application Modeling Framework (SCAMF) for analyzing and designing Smart City applications that is based on the concept of Clean Architecture and adopts the representation formalism of feature models. SCAMF methodology is evaluated through a case study on a Smart Retail Platform. Quality indices like flexibility, extendibility along with metrics as complexity, cohesion and design size are compared to the initial version of the application that was completely re-engineered due to maintenance problems. The results of the study suggest that the proposed methodology improves quality indices like flexibility and extendibility up to 120%.",

      "Abstract": "The HyVar project (www.hyvar-project.eu/) proposes a development framework for continuous and individualized evolution of distributed software applications running on remote devices in heterogeneous environments, focusing on the automotive domain. The framework combines variability modeling and software reuse from software product lines with formal methods and software upgrades and can be integrated in existing software development processes. HyVar’s objectives are: (O1) To develop a Domain Specific Variability Language (DSVL) and tool chain to support software variability for highly distributed applications; (O2) to develop a cloud infrastructure that exploits software variability as described in the DSVL to track the software configurations deployed on remote devices and to enable (i) the collection of data from the devices to monitor their behavior; and (ii) secure and efficient customized updates; (O3) to develop a technology for over-the-air updates of distributed applications, which enables continuous software evolution after deployment on complex remote devices that incorporate a system of systems; and (O4) to test HyVar’s approach as described in the above objectives in an industry-led demonstrator to assess in quantifiable ways its benefits. The end of the project is approaching and we are close to reaching all the objectives. In this paper, we present the integrated tool chain, which combines formal reuse through software product lines with commonly used industrial practices, and supports the development and deployment of individualized software adaptations. We also describe the main benefits for the stakeholders involved.",

      "Title": "Optimal reconfiguration of dynamic software product lines based on performance-influence models",
      "Abstract": "Today's adaptive software systems (i) are often highly configurable product lines, exhibiting hundreds of potentially conflicting configuration options; (ii) are context dependent, forcing the system to reconfigure to ever-changing contextual situations at runtime; (iii) need to fulfill context-dependent performance goals by optimizing measurable nonfunctional properties. Usually, a large number of consistent configurations exists for a given context, and each consistent configuration may perform differently with regard to the current context and performance goal(s). Therefore, it is crucial to consider nonfunctional properties for identifying an appropriate configuration. Existing black-box approaches for estimating the performance of configurations provide no means for determining context-sensitive reconfiguration decisions at runtime that are both consistent and optimal, and hardly allow for combining multiple context-dependent quality goals. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive approach based on Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL) for obtaining consistent and optimal reconfiguration decisions. We use training data obtained from simulations to learn performance-influence models. A novel integrated runtime representation captures both consistency properties and the learned performance-influence models. Our solution provides the flexibility to define multiple context-dependent performance goals. We have implemented our approach as a standalone component. Based on an Internet-of-Things case study using adaptive wireless sensor networks, we evaluate our approach with regard to effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability",

Based on an architecture-centric approach, a DSPL is capable to analyze changes in context, thus responding by performing system adaptations. In this work, we propose an architecture model for DSPL engineering based on the MAPE-K model concept, a feasible strategy to gather and analyze contextual information thus enabling product reconfiguration at runtime. We evaluated the proposed architecture model in a Smart Home System, using OSGi and MQTT. The results are promising, as the DSPL demonstrated its capability to adapt and reconfigure itself according to the new sensors connected to the system.",

      "Abstract": "Based on specific requirements, various Internet of Things (IoT) devices participate in multiple cross-organizational business processes. However, to achieve the desired business value, these IoT resources must be managed efficiently. Configurable Process Model (CPM) facilitates flexibility and reuse by sharing a family of process variants, which can be customized based on concrete business requirements. The classical approaches to develop CPMs focus mainly on the control-flow perspective, without providing concepts to tackle the complexity involved in the IoT domain. In this paper, we address this research gap by proposing configuration concepts for modeling IoT resource variability, which arises due to specific resource properties and behavior such as Replication and Shareability, at the CPM level. Furthermore, we validate our approach based on the results of our experimentation and demonstrate its feasibility through an implemented prototype.",

      "Abstract": "Energy is a critical resource, and designing a sustainable software architecture is a non-Trivial task. Developers require energy metrics that support sustainable software architectures reflecting quality attributes such as security, reliability, performance, etc., identifying what are the concerns that impact more in the energy consumption. A variability model of different designs and implementations of an energy model should exist for this task, as well as a service that stores and compares the experimentation results of energy and time consumption of each concern, finding out what is the most eco-efficient solution. The experimental measurements are performed by energy experts and researchers that share the energy model and metrics in a collaborative repository. HADAS confronts these tasks modelling and reasoning with the variability of energy consuming concerns for different energy contexts, connecting HADAS variability model with its energy efficiency collaborative repository, establishing a Software Product Line (SPL) service. Our main goal is to help developers to perform sustainability analyses finding out the eco-friendliest architecture configurations. A HADAS toolkit prototype is implemented based on a Clafer model and Choco solver, and it has been tested with several case studies.",

      "Abstract": "Pioneers of today’s software industry like Salesforce and Apple have established successful ecosystems around their software platforms. Architectural knowledge of the existing ecosystems is implicit and fragmented among online documentation. In protection of intellectual property, existing documentation hardly reveals influential business strategies that affect the ecosystem structure. Thus, other platform providers can hardly learn from the existing ecosystems in order to systematically make reasonable design decisions with respect to their business strategies to create their own ecosystems. In this paper, we identify a variability model for architectural design decisions of a store-oriented software ecosystem product line from an enterprise perspective, comprising business, application, and infrastructure views. We derive the variability model from fragmentary material of existing ecosystems and a rigorous literature review using a research method based on the design science paradigm. To show its validity, we describe real-world ecosystems from diverse domains using the variability model. This knowledge helps platform providers to develop customized ecosystems or to recreate existing designs in a systematic way. This, in turn, contributes to an increase in designer and developer productivity.",

So far, many experimental results have been published comparing the energy consumption of several alternative solutions, which proven that consumption can be reduced by up to 70%. Although these results are freely available, it is not easy for a developer to apply this knowledge to their applications. Consequently, in this paper we present the HADAS eco-assistant, whose usefulness is: (i) the researchers will store their results in a freely available repository; (ii) developers will be able to reason and get the most energy-efficient configurations that meet their requirements. We will focus on showing the main elements of our proposal and how it applies to real case study of a server machine in a PHP web services development context.",

IoT environments are complex, dynamic, rapidly changing and resource constrained. Therefore, proactively adapting devices to align with context fluctuations becomes a concern. To propose suitable configurations, it should be possible to sense information from devices, analyze the data and reconfigure them accordingly. Applied in the service of the environment, a fleet of devices can monitor environment indicators and control it in order to propose best fit solutions or prevent risks like over consumption of resources (e.g., water and energy). This paper describes our methodology in designing a framework for the monitoring and multi-instantiation of fleets of connected objects. First by identifying the particularities of the fleet, then by specifying connected object as a Dynamic Software Product Line (DSPL), capable of readjusting while running.",

Examples of such limita-Tions are the exclusion of specific protocols, restrictions on the types of data that can be collected, requirements about what information can be transmitted to the public and controls around how that communication occurs. Capturing, representing and designing for these limitations as well as reuse is essential for the quick and successful deployment of such projects.

Additionally, due to the emergence of new computing environments like autonomous systems (e.g., ubiquitous computing and the Internet of Things), there is increasing demand for dynamic adaptations of core assets, and this often needs to be managed with minimum human intervention.We propose an approach for managing a distributed feature model in order to facilitate the adaptation of self-adaptive dynamic software product lines (DSPLs). In addition, our approach allows the change of behaviours to promote the long lifecycle of self-adaptive DSPL. The case study applied in this paper is a baby care system (BCS). BCS assists people to monitor a baby while they are sleeping. We tested our BCS in the following scenarios: Adding features, removing features and changing behaviours. All these scenarios showed that it is possible to use our approach to self-adapt DSPLs.",

To reduce the energy consumption of an application the developer needs: (i) to identify what are the concerns that will impact more in the energy consumption; (ii) to model the variability of alternative designs and implementations of each concern; (iii) to store and compare the experimentation results related with the energy and time consumption of concerns; (iv) to find out what is the most eco-efficient solution for each concern. HADAS addresses these issues by modelling the variability of energy consuming concerns for different energy contexts. It connects the variability model with a repository that stores energy measurements, providing a Software Product Line (SPL) service, helping developers to reason and find out what are the most ecofriendly configurations.

      "Abstract": "A Software Product Line (SPL) is a set of similar programs, called variants, with a common code base and well documented variability. Because the number of variants in an SPL can be large, checking them efficiently (e.g., to ensure that they are all well-typed) is a challenging problem. Delta-Oriented Programming (DOP) is a flexible approach to implement SPLs. The Abstract Behavioral Specification (ABS) modeling language and toolchain supports delta-oriented SPLs. In this paper we present an extension of the ABS toolchain with a mechanism for checking that all the variants of an SPL can be generated and are well-typed ABS programs. Currently we have implemented only part of this mechanism: our implementation (integrated in version 1.4.2 of the ABS toolchain and released in April 2017) checks whether all variants can be generated, however it does not check, in particular, whether the bodies of the methods are well-typed. Empirical evaluation shows that the current implementation allows for efficient partial type checking of existing ABS SPLs.",

      "Abstract": "Advances in device technology have promoted the development of small appliances such as wearable devices, IoT equipment, and small home electronics equipment. Considering a product family of such device/equipment, each product in the family may have different hardware (micro controller unit, devices such as sensors and actuators, and different configurations). Software for such equipment tends to be compact and handles the devices directly via drivers. However, software engineers are not familiar with driver development and this causes development bottleneck. Therefore, in order to develop products efficiently, derivations of software and hardware are not enough, i.e., the systematic derivation of drivers is indispensable. In this paper, we propose a system product line development method for small appliances in which drivers are systematically derived. In this method, hardware features and software features are managed in terms of feature models, and system products are derived by specifying features of hardware and software. Based on these, drivers are systematically derived. This paper proposes 1) an extension of the UML/MARTE model that can represent hardware information that is necessary for driver generation, and 2) a systematic driver derivation method based on variability management and model-driven engineering techniques. We evaluate the method using an example of a motion tracking system product family.",

      "Abstract": "The development of safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is expanding due to the Internet of Things' promise to make high-integrity applications and services part of everyday life. This expansion is seen in the dependencies some connected vehicles have on cloud services that provide guidance and accident avoidance / detection features. Such systems are safety-critical since failure could result in serious injury or death. Due to the severe consequences of failure, fault-tolerance, reliability and dependability should be primary driving qualities in the design and development of these systems. However, the cost of the analysis, evaluation and certification activities needed to ensure that the possibility of failure has been sufficiently mitigated is significantly higher than the cost of developing traditional software. Our group is exploring the addition of dynamic adaptive capabilities to safety-critical systems. We postulate that dynamic adaptivity could provide several enhancements to safety-critical systems. It would allow systems to reason about the environment within which they are sited and about their internal operation enabling decision making that is context-specific and appropriately prioritized. However, the addition of adaptivity with the associated overhead of reasoning is not without drawbacks particularly when hard real-time safety-critical systems are involved. In this brief position paper, we explore some of the questions and concerns that are raised when dynamic adaptive behavior is introduced into safety-critical systems as well as ways that the Architecture Analysis & Design Language (AADL) can be used to model / analyze such systems.",

However, the methods fail to describe feature in details especially for embedded software product line engineering. As for these deficiencies, this paper combines the characteristics of the embedded products, with the domain ontology as the basis of feature modeling, dividing the feature modeling into building domain ontology and the feature analysis. First, it will identify the concept of mutual recognition through acquiring, describing and denoting the related domain knowledge. Then, it will divide the feature into three parts which are concept, attribute and the relation, and describe the feature from connotation and extension. It defines and normalizes feature in a clear way. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed modeling method will be verified through a ventilator embedded product line.",

Recently, there have been increasing demands for dynamic product reconfiguration in various application areas (e.g., ubiquitous computing, self-healing systems, etc.); however, most product line engineering methods in the literature have focused on the development of reusable core assets for statically configured products. In this paper, we propose a feature-oriented approach to develop dynamically reconfigurable core assets. This approach takes feature binding analysis results as a key design driver for identifying and managing variation points of dynamically reconfigurable products. We also provide a conceptual model for a reconfigurator, which monitors and manages product reconfiguration at run time. The method is illustrated with a home service robot product line example",

Developing and deploying the data collection architectures of these systems is a challenging problem. The specificities of the sensor platforms compel software engineers to work at a low level. This makes this activity tedious, producing code that badly exploits the network architecture, and hampering reuse of data collection policies. Moreover, several data collection programs cannot be guaranteed to be deployable on a shared infrastructure. In this paper, we present an automated approach that supports (i) the definition of data collection policies at a higher level of abstraction, (ii) the representation of the diverse platforms and the network topology, and (iii) the automatic composition and deployment of the policies on top of heterogeneous sensing infrastructures following different strategies. The approach is tooled and has been assessed on both realistic and simulated deployments.",

      "Abstract": "Software Product Lines (SPLs) are a mechanism for largescale reuse where families of related software systems are represented in terms of commonalities and variabilities, e.g., using Feature Models (FMs). While FMs define all possible configurations of the SPL, when considering dynamic SPLs not every possible configuration may be valid in all possible contexts. Unfortunately, common FMs can not capture this context dependence. In this paper, we remedy this problem by extending attributed FMs with Validity Formulas (VFs) that constrain the selection of a particular feature to a speci fic context and that are located directly within the FM. We provide a reconfiguration engine that checks if the active configuration is valid in the current context and, if not, computes how to reconfigure it. Furthermore, we present our implementation and demonstrate its feasibility within a case study derived from scenarios of our industry partner in the automotive domain.",

These processes include, inter alia, context modeling and reasoning as well as adaptation. In [1], we presented an approach that consists of context modeling and reasoning hand in hand based on relational concept analysis and descriptive logic, respectively. An essential aspect that is often neglected in context modeling and also triggers adaptation is the context variability. In this paper, we propose an approach that lies to answer this matter based on software product line. Our approach creates a semantic link between a context RCA-based model and a feature model, and uses the MAPE-K adaptation loop to determine the appropriate SPL configurations to deploy with regards to context changes. Thus, we used ontology to represent a combined context and feature model. Thereafter, the reasoning is done via descriptive logic. We also defined context rules based on SWRL and applied them to valid SPL configurations. Furthermore, we implemented the MAPE-K adaptation loop with Prolog.",

To stimulate innovation on their platforms, manufacturers of embedded products are creating software ecosystems that enable third-parties develop applications for their devices. Since such applications are developed externally, their seamless integration into the platforms is a challenge. In this paper, we propose to use semantic reasoning to select and configure applications in software ecosystems. Our prototype builds a model of the installation and the user goals through several steps. It processes application descriptions created by their developers and matches them to the installation model. Based on the matched descriptions, it presents options to deploy applications in the environment to the user sorted by their relevance. The proposed approach enables resolving complex requirements of applications before their installation in the platform. Our preliminary evaluation shows that the prototype supports the integration of the identified applications.",

Context information plays a major role in developing such self-adaptive and energy-aware software. Any changes in context information may exhibit different number of operating conditions at run-time. The software should be efficiently developed to be more energy-efficient under different operating conditions through well defined dynamic adaptation policies. Developing such energy-aware adaptive behavior is a challenging task with current programming methods. We employed feature-oriented software development (FOSD) for developing such energy-aware self-adaptive software. In this paper, as first step, domain analysis framework for energy-aware self-adaptive software is proposed. The proposed framework uses feature models to explicitly specify the energy-aware features and context information. An illustrative example is presented to show the usefulness of the proposed domain analysis framework.",

A context life cycle implies 4 essential steps: context acquisition, context modeling, context reasoning and context dissemination [1]. In [2], we tackled the issue of context modeling and reasoning by proposing an approach based on Relational Concept Analysis (RCA) and Descriptive Logic (DL), respectively. A main aspect that is neglected in context model is the context variability, which we refer to it as a range or set of context values of an environment along which that environment changes. Context variability can benefit from software product lines [3]. For this reason, this paper proposes an approach describing the relationship between a context RCA-based model and a feature model in order to describe the variability of contexts in which software of a software product line is used. Thus, we represent a feature model as ontology to obtain a semantic model. We also define context rules derived from the context model and based on SWRL that we apply to SPL configurations. We explain the inferred reasoning justifications obtained from a reasoner and detail the implementation of our proposed approach.",

      "Abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) is the concept of connecting multiple objects together in an Internet-based architecture. Applications built around this concept are constantly growing in variety and quantity. Technologies in IoT have been evolving rapidly and the alternatives also have increased quickly. As a result, it becomes challenging to conduct system and software trade-off analysis or select suitable IoT technologies for applications. The paper emphasizes variability management (consisting of alternative technologies) and aims to provide a framework as a result, which would allow or facilitate users to create their own IoT applications. In order to achieve this goal, we have adopted the idea of software product line engineering (SPLE) and created a framework with a layered architecture consisting of a Cloud Layer, a Central Hub Layer, and an End Devices Layer. The layers are loosely coupled with well-defined interfaces allowing for variability to be added at each layer. We were successfully able to create a framework which allows users to build their own applications, only being limited by the devices supported by the framework.",

      "Abstract": "In system design, the distinction between a logical architecture at design level and the corresponding physical distributed architecture at implementation level is recognised as good practice. In this paper we show how we can define logical architectures in which variation points can be defined explicitly. Such architectures define families of systems, and should therefore be useful for defining such families in IoT.",

      "Title": "Sensor Data Visualisation: A Composition-Based Approach to Support Domain Variability",
      "Abstract": "In the context of the Internet of Things, sensors are surrounding our environment. These small pieces of electronics are inserted in everyday life's elements (e.g., cars, doors, radiators, smartphones) and continuously collect information about their environment. One of the biggest challenges is to support the development of accurate monitoring dashboard to visualise such data. The one-size-fits-all paradigm does not apply in this context, as user's roles are variable and impact the way data should be visualised: a building manager does not need to work on the same data as classical users. This paper presents an approach based on model composition techniques to support the development of such monitoring dashboards, taking into account the domain variability. This variability is supported at both implementation and modelling levels. The results are validated on a case study named SmartCampus, involving sensors deployed in a real academic campus. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",

      "Abstract": "One of the most important challenges of this decade is the Internet of Things (IoT) or the integration of devices from the real world in the Internet. IoT systems are usually composed of heterogenous and interconnected lightweight devices that support applications that are subject to change in their external environment and in the functioning of these devices. The management of the variability of these changes, autonomously, is a challenge in the development of these systems. Agents are a good option to develop IoT systems due to their distributed nature, context-awareness and self-adaptation. Our goal is to enhance the development of IoT applications using agents and advanced software techniques like Variability Modeling. Specifically, we propose to use Self-StarMAS agents and CVL. In this contribution, we propose a CVL process for the development of Self-StarMAS agents.",

      "Abstract": "One of the most important challenges of this decade is the Internet of Things (IoT) that pursues the integration of real-world objects in the virtual world of the Internet. One property that characterises IoT systems is that they have to react to variable and continuous changes. This means that IoT systems need to work as self-managed systems to effectively manage context changes. The autonomy property inherent to software agents makes them a suitable choice for developing self-managed IoT systems. By embedding agents in the devices that compose the IoT is possible to realize a decentralized system with selfmanagement capacities. However, in this scenario new problems arise. Firstly, current agent development approaches lack mechanisms to deal with the heterogeneity present in the IoT domain. Secondly, agents must simultaneously deal with potentially conflicting changes in their behaviour, concerning self-management and application goals. In order to afford these challenges we propose to use an approach based on Dynamic Software Product Lines (D-SPL) and preference-based reasoning. The D-SPL provides to the preference-based reasoning of the agent with the necessary information to adapt its behaviour at runtime making a tradeoff between the self-management of the system and the accomplishment of its application goals.",

      "Abstract": "One of the most important challenges of this decade is the Internet of Things (IoT) that pursues the integration of real-world objects in Internet. One of the key areas of the IoT is the Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems, which should be able to react to variable and continuous changes while ensuring their acceptance and adoption by users. This means that AAL systems need to work as self-adaptive systems. The autonomy property inherent to software agents, makes them a suitable choice for developing self-adaptive systems. However, agents lack the mechanisms to deal with the variability present in the IoT domain with regard to devices and network technologies. To overcome this limitation we have already proposed a Software Product Line (SPL) process for the development of self-adaptive agents in the IoT. Here we analyze the challenges that poses the development of self-adaptive AAL systems based on agents. To do so, we focus on the domain and application engineering of the self-adaptation concern of our SPL process. In addition, we provide a validation of our development process for AAL systems.",

      "Abstract": "Smart farming adopts advanced technology and the corresponding principles to increase the amount of production and economic returns, often also with the goal to reduce the impact on the environment. One of the key elements of smart farming is the farm management information systems (FMISs) that supports the automation of data acquisition and processing, monitoring, planning, decision making, documenting, and managing the farm operations. An increased number of FMISs now adopt internet of things (IoT) technology to further optimize the targeted business goals. Obviously IoT systems in agriculture typically have different functional and quality requirements such as choice of communication protocols, the data processing capacity, the security level, safety level, and time performance. For developing an IoT-based FMIS, it is important to design the proper architecture that meets the corresponding requirements. To guide the architect in designing the IoT based farm management information system that meets the business objectives a systematic approach is provided. To this end a design-driven research approach is adopted in which feature-driven domain analysis is used to model the various smart farming requirements. Further, based on a FMIS and IoT reference architectures the steps and the modeling approaches for designing IoT-based FMIS architectures are described. The approach is illustrated using two case studies on smart farming in Turkey, one for smart wheat production in Konya, and the other for smart green houses in Antalya.",

When sensors that are members of multiple IoT gateways can inter-operate at the same time for more than one application, it will reduce cost to deploy IoT infrastructure. However, reliability has also developed as the most important aspect for real-time data collection that should be streamed constantly. Due to uncertainty factors sensors failure is potentially occurred, then an adaptive approach should be addressed into this as to guarantee the flow of streaming data. This paper proposed an adaptive sensor-cloud mechanism to manage the reliability by using a runtime model approach where a transition model and dynamic software product line engineering will take place to weaving the system. Our technique is comparable to other approaches and can be implemented in many types of Cloud-based services.",

      "Title": "Multi-Objective Optimum Solutions for IoT-Based Feature Models of Software Product Line",
      "Abstract": "A software product line is used for the development of a family of products utilizing the reusability of existing resources with low costs and time to market. Feature Model (FM) is used extensively to manage the common and variable features of a family of products, such as Internet of Things (IoT) applications. In the literature, the binary pattern for nested cardinality constraints (BPNCC) approach has been proposed to compute all possible combinations of development features for IoT applications without violating any relationship constraints. Relationship constraints are a predefined set of rules for the selection of features from an FM. Due to high probability of relationship constraints violations, obtaining optimum features combinations from large IoT-based FMs are a challenging task. Therefore, in order to obtain optimum solutions, in this paper, we have proposed multi-objective optimum-BPNCC that consists of three independent paths (first, second, and third). Furthermore, we applied heuristics on these paths and found that the first path is infeasible due to space and execution time complexity. The second path reduces the space complexity; however, time complexity increases due to the increasing group of features. Among these paths, the performance of the third path is best as it removes optional features that are not required for optimization. In experiments, we calculated the outcomes of all three paths that show the significant improvement of optimum solution without constraint violation occurrence. We theoretically prove that this paper is better than previously proposed optimization algorithms, such as a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm and an indicator-based evolutionary algorithm.",

The review covered 238 journal papers from five digital libraries. The 55 papers that met the review inclusion criteria focused on 22 NFRs, each describing a unique system behavior quality. The most dominant of these NFRs were interoperability,usability,performance,security, privacy, safety, and accuracy. A noticeable NFR gap is the notion of caring. It is not readily apparent how a medical device that monitors a patient or delivers medications or anesthetics can “care about” the sufferings, feelings and emotional needs of a patient; however, in the healthcare arena these are valid concerns. A second theme found in the papers reviewed focused on software standards/process improvement when developing software intensive medical devices. This research also provides an analysis of the software architecture tactics those researchers utilized to implement the NFRs in the medical devices.",

      "Title": "Building reliable and maintainable Dynamic Software Product Lines: An investigation in the Body Sensor Network domain",
      "Abstract": "Context: Dependability is a key requirement, especially in safety-critical applications. Many of these applications have changing context and configurations at runtime to achieve functional and quality goals and can be realized as Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs). DSPL constitutes an emerging but promising research area. Nevertheless, ensuring dependability in DSPLs remains insufficiently explored, especially in terms of reliability and maintainability. This compromises quality assurance and applicability of DSPLs in safety-critical domains, such as Body Sensor Network (BSN). Objective: To address this issue, we propose an approach to developing reliable and maintainable DSPLs in the context of the BSN domain. Method: Adaptation plans are instances of a Domain Specific Language (DSL) describing reliability goals and adaptability at runtime. These instances are automatically checked for reliability goal satisfiability before being deployed and interpreted at runtime to provide more suitable adaptation goals complying with evolving needs perceived by a domain specialist. Results: The approach is evaluated in the BSN domain. Results show that reliability and maintainability could be provided with execution and reconfiguration times of around 30 ms, notification and adaptation plan update time over the network around 5 s, and space consumption around 5 MB. Conclusion: The method is feasible at reasonable cost. The incurred benefits are reliable vital signal monitoring for the patient—thus providing early detection of serious health issues and the possibility of proactive treatment—and a maintainable infrastructure allowing medical DSL instance update to suit the needs of the domain specialist and ultimately of the patient.",

      "Abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) can be used anywhere, anytime and with any device. IoT devices are used broadly in recent industry such as health care, transport, education and communication channels. IoT applications make enable the use of IoT systems in different environment such as heat sensor functionality varies for indoor and outdoor, water sensors in automobile for screen viper movement (auto working during rain and stop if there is no raining), heartbeat sensors for old and young patients. Moreover, IoT devices are same but the operating functionality is different according to environment and end user’s perspective. Therefore, this kind of variability management is very important for reusability of resources in multiple environments. However, variability management is difficult task due to the dependency of resources, relationships between them and compatibility issues. Feature Modeling of Software Product Line (SPL) is extensively used to manage the variability management for family of software that share common resources and varies in different points. In this paper we have proposed simple and effective approach for variability management of IoT-based applications by using feature modeling. We have proposed XML-based feature modeling for IoT-based applications for variability management and increase the reusability of existing resources. Our approach defines the complete package from domain modeling to application development by using XML-schema and XSLT files to select and deselect the features for final application development. Our final architecture of IoT-based feature model shows the complete relationships and include exclude associations between them without any constraint violations.",

      "Abstract": "Complexity of Internet of Things (IoT) applications and difficulty to predict their behaviour in wireless communications make modelling of IoT units an important research topic. The IoT unit is considered here as the two-node IoT model that supports bi-directional wireless communications. There are many approaches to model security and energy awareness; however, little is known about the synergistic effect of those factors at the application level under the influence of environmental factors such as noise. The paper introduces a modelling framework to model the security-energy-environment issues as main attributes to allow defining quality of service (QoS) for the IoT-based applications. Among others, the healthcare ones are regarded as predominant now. We model IoT units using the feature-based modelling methodology adopted from the software engineering domain. The result of modelling is a set of feature models with valid configurations that describe the energy-security-environment-performance relationships and possible constraints to support various IoT applications. Having feature models, we can select a configuration that is best suited for a given IoT application with respect to QoS requirements. As feature models represent abstract relationships of domain factors, we need additionally to provide experiments to determine concrete values of modelled features. We describe the experimental system to measure energy consumption under the influencing factors. Both models (abstract and concrete) allow reasoning about QoS of the IoT applications.

      "Title": "Model-Driven Approach for Body Area Network Application Development",
      "Abstract": "This paper introduces the sensor-networked IoT model as a prototype to support the design of Body Area Network (BAN) applications for healthcare. Using the model, we analyze the synergistic effect of the functional requirements (data collection from the human body and transferring it to the top level) and non-functional requirements (trade-offs between energy-security-environmental factors, treated as Quality-of-Service (QoS)). We use feature models to represent the requirements at the earliest stage for the analysis and describe a model-driven methodology to design the possible BAN applications. Firstly, we specify the requirements as the problem domain (PD) variability model for the BAN applications. Next, we introduce the generative technology (meta-programming as the solution domain (SD)) and the mapping procedure to map the PD feature-based variability model onto the SD feature model. Finally, we create an executable meta-specification that represents the BAN functionality to describe the variability of the problem domain though transformations. The meta-specification (along with the meta-language processor) is a software generator for multiple BAN-oriented applications. We validate the methodology with experiments and a case study to generate a family of programs for the BAN sensor controllers. This enables to obtain the adequate measure of QoS efficiently through the interactive adjustment of the meta-parameter values and re-generation process for the concrete BAN application.",

      "Abstract": "Context: Software engineering for ubiquitous systems has experienced an important and rapid growth, however the vast research corpus makes it difficult to obtain valuable information from it. Objective: To identify, evaluate, and synthesize research about the most relevant approaches addressing the different phases of the software development life cycle for ubiquitous systems. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review of papers presenting and evaluating approaches for the different phases of the software development life cycle for ubiquitous systems. Approaches were classified according to the phase of the development cycle they addressed, identifying their main concerns and limitations. Results: We identified 128 papers reporting 132 approaches addressing issues related to different phases of the software development cycle for ubiquitous systems. Most approaches have been aimed at addressing the implementation, evolution/maintenance, and feedback phases, while others phases such as testing need more attention from researchers. Conclusion: We recommend to follow existing guidelines when conducting case studies to make the studies more reproducible and closer to real life cases. While some phases of the development cycle have been extensively explored, there is still room for research in other phases, toward a more agile and integrated cycle, from requirements to testing and feedback.",

      "Abstract": "The complexity of information systems is increasing in recent years, leading to increased effort for maintenance and configuration. Self-adaptive systems (SASs) address this issue. Due to new computing trends, such as pervasive computing, miniaturization of IT leads to mobile devices with the emerging need for context adaptation. Therefore, it is beneficial that devices are able to adapt context. Hence, we propose to extend the definition of SASs and include context adaptation. This paper presents a taxonomy of self-adaptation and a survey on engineering SASs. Based on the taxonomy and the survey, we motivate a new perspective on SAS including context adaptation.",

      "Title": "Architectural evolution of FamiWare using cardinality-based feature models",
      "Abstract": "Context: Ambient Intelligence systems domain is an outstanding example of modern systems that are in permanent evolution, as new devices, technologies or facilities are continuously appearing. This means it would be desirable to have a mechanism that helps with the propagation of evolution changes in deployed systems. Objective: We present a software product line engineering process to manage the evolution of FamiWare, a family of middleware for ambient intelligence environments. This process drives the evolution of FamiWare middleware configurations using cardinality-based feature models, which are especially well suited to express the structural variability of ambient intelligence systems. Method: FamiWare uses cardinality-based feature models and clonable features to model the structural variability present in ambient intelligence systems, composed of a large variety of heterogeneous devices. Since the management evolution of configurations with clonable features is manually untreatable due to the high number of features, our process automates it and propagates changes made at feature level to the architectural components of the FamiWare middleware. This is a model driven development process as the evolution management, the propagation of evolution changes and the code generation are performed using some kind of model mappings and transformations. Concretely we present a variability modelling language to map the selection of features to the corresponding FamiWare middleware architectural components. Results: Our process is able to manage the evolution of cardinality-based feature models with thousands of features, something which is not possible to tackle manually. Thanks to the use of the variability language and the automatic code generation it is possible to propagate and maintain a correspondence between the FamiWare architectural model and the code. The process is then able to calculate the architectural differences between the evolved configuration and the previous one. Checking these differences, our process helps to calculate the effort needed to perform the evolution changes in the customized products. To perform those tasks we have defined two operators, one to calculate the differences between two feature model configurations and another to create a new configuration from a previous one. Conclusion: Our process automatically propagates the evolution changes of the middleware family into the existing configurations where the middleware is already deployed and also helps us to calculate the effort in performing the changes in every configuration. Finally, we validated our approach, demonstrating the functioning of the defined operators and showing that by using our tool we can generate evolved configurations for FamiWare with thousands of cloned features, for several case studies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

      "Title": "A Model-Driven Framework to Develop Personalized Health Monitoring",
      "Abstract": "Both distributed healthcare systems and the Internet of Things (IoT) are currently hot topics. The latter is a new computing paradigm to enable advanced capabilities in engineering various applications, including those for healthcare. For such systems, the core social requirement is the privacy/security of the patient information along with the technical requirements (e.g., energy consumption) and capabilities for adaptability and personalization. Typically, the functionality of the systems is predefined by the patient's data collected using sensor networks along with medical instrumentation; then, the data is transferred through the Internet for treatment and decision-making. Therefore, systems creation is indeed challenging. In this paper, we propose a model-driven framework to develop the IoT-based prototype and its reference architecture for personalized health monitoring (PHM) applications. The framework contains a multi-layered structure with feature-based modeling and feature model transformations at the top and the application software generation at the bottom. We have validated the framework using available tools and developed an experimental PHM to test some aspects of the functionality of the reference architecture in real time. The main contribution of the paper is the development of the model-driven computational framework with emphasis on the synergistic effect of security and energy issues.",

      "Title": "Binary Pattern for Nested Cardinality Constraints for Software Product Line of IoT-Based Feature Models",
      "Abstract": "Software product line (SPL) is extensively used for reusability of resources in family of products. Feature modeling is an important technique used to manage common and variable features of SPL in applications, such as Internet of Things (IoT). In order to adopt SPL for application development, organizations require information, such as cost, scope, complexity, number of features, total number of products, and combination of features for each product to start the application development. Application development of IoT is varied in different contexts, such as heat sensor indoor and outdoor environment. Variability management of IoT applications enables to find the cost, scope, and complexity. All possible combinations of features make it easy to find the cost of individual application. However, exact number of all possible products and features combination for each product is more valuable information for an organization to adopt product line. In this paper, we have proposed binary pattern for nested cardinality constraints (BPNCC), which is simple and effective approach to calculate the exact number of products with complex relationships between application's feature models. Furthermore, BPNCC approach identifies the feasible features combinations of each IoT application by tracing the constraint relationship from top-to-bottom. BPNCC is an open source and tool-independent approach that does not hide the internal information of selected and non-selected IoT features. The proposed method is validated by implementing it on small and large IoT application feature models with 'n' number of constraints, and it is found that the total number of products and all features combinations in each product without any constraint violation.",

      "Title": "A software product line process to develop agents for the IoT",
      "Abstract": "One of the most important challenges of this decade is the Internet of Things (IoT), which aims to enable things to be connected anytime, anyplace, with anything and anyone, ideally using any path/network and any service. IoT systems are usually composed of heterogeneous and interconnected lightweight devices that support applications that are subject to change in their external environment and in the functioning of these devices. The management of the variability of these changes, autonomously, is a challenge in the development of these systems. Agents are a good option for developing self-managed IoT systems due to their distributed nature, context-awareness and self-adaptation. Our goal is to enhance the development of IoT applications using agents and software product lines (SPL). Specifically, we propose to use Self-StarMASMAS, multi-agent system) agents and to define an SPL process using the Common Variability Language. In this contribution, we propose an SPL process for Self-StarMAS, paying particular attention to agents embedded in sensor motes.",
