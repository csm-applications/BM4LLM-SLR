      "Abstract": "Empowering end-users to wire Internet of Things (IoT) objects (things and services) together would allow them to more easily conceive and realize interesting IoT solutions. A challenge lies in devising a simple end-user development approach to support the specification of transformations, which can bridge the mismatch in the data being exchanged among IoT objects. To tackle this challenge, we present Visual Simple Transformations (ViSiT) as an approach that allows end-users to use a jigsaw puzzle metaphor for specifying transformations that are automatically converted into underlying executable workflows. ViSiT is explained by presenting meta-models and an architecture for implementing a system of connected IoT objects. A tool is provided for supporting end-users in visually developing and testing transformations. Another tool is also provided for allowing software developers to modify, if they wish, a transformation's underlying implementation. This work was evaluated from a technical perspective by developing transformations and measuring ViSiT's efficiency and scalability and by constructing an example application to show ViSiT's practicality. A study was conducted to evaluate this work from an end-user perspective, and its results showed positive indications of perceived usability, learnability, and the ability to conceive real-life scenarios for ViSiT.",

The comprehensive use of models in design has created a set of challenges beyond those of supporting one isolated design task. In particular, the need to combine, couple, and integrate models at different levels of abstraction and in different formalisms is posing a set of specific problems that must be tackled. Multi-Paradigm Modeling is precisely the research field to focus on developing an appropriate set of concepts and tools to address the challenge of integrating models of different aspects of a software system specified using different formalisms and eventually at different levels of abstraction.

      "Abstract": "One of the essential means of supporting Human-Machine Interaction is a (software) language, exploited to input commands andreceive corresponding outputs in a well-dened manner. In the past,language creation and customization used to be accessible to softwaredevelopers only. But today, as software applications gain more ubiquity,these features tend to be more accessible to application users themselves.However, current language development techniques are still based on tra-ditional concepts of human-machine interaction, i.e. manipulating textand/or diagrams by means of more or less sophisticated keypads (e.g.mouse and keyboard).In this paper we propose to enhance the typical approach for dealing withlanguage intensive applications by widening available human-machine in-teractions to multiple modalities, including sounds, gestures, and theircombination. In particular, we adopt a Multi-Paradigm Modelling ap-proach in which the forms of interaction can be specied by means ofappropriate modelling techniques. The aim is to provide a more advancedhuman-machine interaction support for language intensive applications.",

      "Title": "Special issue on quality in model-driven engineering",
      "Abstract": "Model-driven engineering (MDE) refers to a range of approaches where models play a core role in software development. Modeling promotes reasoning at a higher level of abstraction, therefore reducing complexity of software development, while hiding the unnecessary low level details at appropriate stages, and promoting communication among the several stakeholders in the development process. MDE initiatives make claims of increased quality and productivity by separating business and application logic from underlying platform technology, transforming models to other models and automating code generation. However, while quality assurance is a well-known topic in traditional software engineering, less is known on how to assess quality across the MDE lifecycle. We should understand not only how to measure the quality of the MDE process (and determine whether it is better than other approaches), but also understand the quality of the models themselves (determining metrics for the quality of both models and metamodels, design patterns and anti-patterns). This special issue aimed at being the proper place to share mature research, ground-breaking ideas and experience reports in QMDE. From 26 submissions, which shows the interest in the topic, and after a strict peer-review process involving at least 3 reviewers per paper (and 5 or 6 different ones in some), 7 were finally selected. The presented contributions range from topics related to the MDD process starting with the quality of requirements, to the model evolution and reuse process, passing by the concern with languages quality (concrete vs. graphical, complexity of developed DSLs, DSL environments for agents), talking about quality in model transformations, and finishing with aspects related to the semantics and time concerns in the behavior models.",

After a maturing period of over a decade, Model-Driven Engineering (Mde) starts to extend to novel areas that include safetycritical or embedded, but also cyberphysical systems.

Without claiming for exhaustivity, we validate our approach by analysis several contributions from the literature, thus offering an overview of the current practice in Real-Time Mde.",

      "Abstract": "The introduction of ontological classification to support domain-metamodeling has been pivotal in the emergence of multi-level modeling as a dynamic research area. However, existing expositions of ontological classification have only used a limited context to distinguish it from the historically more commonly used linguistic classification. In important areas such as domain-specific languages and classic language engineering the distinction can appear to become blurred and the role of ontological classification is obscured, if not fundamentally challenged. In this paper we therefore examine critical points of confusion regarding the distinction and provide an expanded explanation of the differences. We maintain that optimally utilizing ontological classification, even for tasks that traditionally have only been viewed as language engineering, is critical for mastering the challenges in complex systems modeling including the validation of multi-language models.",

      "Abstract": "Lighting system design is a significant component of building and is considered as an important aspect when addressing sustainability of buildings. Achieving sustainability in buildings would tackle through energy conservation and waste savings. In most of the industrialised countries, rising energy costs make indoor artificial lightings as a significant contributor. Thus, visual comfort within the indoor environment could be affected by an energy-saving strategy. This paper organises a systematic state of the art review of indoor lighting simulation related to the buildings research. Simulation allows artificial objects and dynamical role variations to optimise the maximal use of lighting systems in buildings. Thus, it allows equivalent lighting system design and the synthetic environment in a virtual world. This strategy makes it possible to design and select the subjective state of the physical and virtual well-being of the visual comfort in the buildings. The main objective of this paper is to find out the most popular simulation tool adopted for the simulation of lighting in the building prototypes by various researchers. The simulation platforms are categorised in simple tools and integrated tools. The survey comprises of seventy papers which were thoroughly reviewed. It is observed that various relevant studies were carried out by different researchers in the energy savings and lighting in buildings and their prototypes were found during the survey. This research can positively aid the researchers and energy managers in deciding the feasible simulation tool for simulating their respective prototypes.",

The evaluation technique is based on a performance-oriented reinterpretation of the BPEL specification as a performance modeling language within a multiformalism framework.

      "Title": "Usability driven DSL development with USE-ME",
      "Abstract": "The adoption of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) is regarded as an approach to reduce the accidental complexity of software systems development. The availability of sophisticated language workbenches facilitates the development of DSLs making them increasingly more popular. The adoption of DSLs at large comes at the risk that a poorly designed DSL can be too hard to adopt by its domain users. As such, Usability is one of the essential characteristics to mitigate this risk as it has an important impact on the productivity achieved by DSL users. The current state of practice in Software Language Engineering (SLE) neglects the Usability of DSLs. A pertinent research question in SLE is how to engineer Usability into DSLs systematically. We argue that a timely systematic approach based on User Interface experimental evaluation techniques should be used to assess the impact of DSLs during their development process, while the cost of fixing the usability problems is relatively small, when compared to fixing them at the end of the development process. For that purpose, we introduce a conceptual framework, called USE-ME, which supports the iterative incremental development process of DSLs concerning the issue of their Usability evaluation. We illustrate the feasibility of the approach on a case study of the development of a DSL meant for children to program robots.",

The quantification is achieved through the integration of two models: one that concentrates more on the structure of the power grid and its physical quantities and one that concentrates on the behavior of the control system supported by the II. The modeling approach is exemplified on a scenario whose goal is to study the effects of an II partial failure (a denial of service attack that compromises the communication network) on the remote control of the EI. The approach has been initially developed as part of the European project CRUTIAL. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

Specifically, we discuss challenges associated with developing effective mechanisms for supervising running systems, reasoning about and planning adaptations, maintaining consistency among multiple runtime models, and maintaining fidelity of runtime models with respect to the running system and its environment. We discuss related problems and state-of-the-art mechanisms, and identify open research challenges.",

They promise essentially unrestricted language composition as well as flexible notations, which supports aligning languages with their respective domain and constitutes an essential ingredient of model-driven development. Such editors have existed since the 1980s and gained widespread attention with the Intentional Programming paradigm, which used projectional editing at its core. However, despite the benefits, programming still mainly relies on editing textual code, where projectional editors imply a very different-typically perceived as worse-editing experience, often seen as the main challenge prohibiting their widespread adoption. We present an experiment of code-editing activities in a projectional editor, conducted with 19 graduate computer-science students and industrial developers. We investigate the effects of projectional editing on editing efficiency, editing strategies, and error rates-each of which we also compare to conventional, parser-based editing. We observe that editing is efficient for basic-editing tasks, but that editing strategies and typical errors differ. More complex tasks require substantial experience and a better understanding of the abstract-syntax-Tree structure-then, projectional editing is also efficient. We also witness a tradeoff between fewer typing mistakes and an increased complexity of code editing.",

      "Abstract": "In this paper, we investigate change-driven model transformations, a novel class of transformations, which are directly triggered by complex model changes carried out by arbitrary transactions on the model (e. g. editing operation, transformation, etc). After a classification of relevant change scenarios, we identify challenges for change-driven transformations. As the main technical contribution of the current paper, we define an expressive, high-level language for specifying change-driven transformations as an extension of graph patterns and graph transformation rules. This language generalizes previous results on live model transformations by offering trigger events for arbitrarily complex model changes, and dedicated reactions for specific kinds of changes, making this way the concept of change to be a first-class citizen of the transformation language. We discuss how the underlying transformation engine needs to be adapted in order to use the same language uniformly for different change scenarios. The technicalities of our approach will be discussed on a (1) model synchronization case study with non-materialized target models and (2) a case study on detecting the violation of evolutionary (temporal) constraints in the security requirements engineering domain. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",

      "Abstract": "In this paper, the QAML (Quantitative Analysis Modeling Language) DSML is presented. It is a formalism for representing quantitative analysis models applied to embedded system architecture models. Issued from the need to standardize the representation of heterogeneous power consumption analysis models, QAML has been generalized to support the analysis of arbitrary physical quantities. Following a Multi-Paradigm Modeling (MPM) approach and the principle of separation of concerns, QAML combines a set of DSMLs such as the SysML QUDV annex, the W3C MathML and other custom DSMLs to favor interoperability and reuse. Using an enhanced Atlas Model Weaving language, embedded systems architecture models of arbitrary languages such as AADL can be annotated with quantitative estimation models issued from measurements campaigns, numerical simulations or other means. The complete set of models in the MPM environment is interpretable to provide analysis results in system architecture models.",

      "Abstract": "This paper introduces a novel model-driven methodology for the software development of real-Time distributed vehicular embedded systems on single-And multi-core platforms. The proposed methodology discloses the opportunity of improving the cost-efficiency of the development process by providing automated support to identify viable design solutions with respect to selected non-functional requirements. To this end, it leverages the interplay of modeling languages for the vehicular domain whose integration is achieved by a suite of model transformations. An instantiation of the methodology is discussed for timing requirements, which are among the most critical ones for vehicular systems. To support the design of temporally correct systems, cooperation between EAST-ADL and the Rubus component model is opportunely built-up by means of model transformations, enabling timing-Aware design and model-based timing analysis of the system. The applicability of the methodology is demonstrated as the proof of concepts on industrial use cases performed in cooperation with our industrial partners.",

      "Abstract": "Big data processing systems are characterized by a relevant number of components that are used in parallel to run multiple instances of the same tasks in order to achieve the needed performance levels in applications characterized by huge amounts of data. Such a number of components depend on the dimension of the involved data, so that new resources (e.g., processing or storage servers) are usually added as the working database grows. A reliable performance evaluation of these systems is at the same time crucial, in order to enable administrators and developers to keep the pace with data growth, and extremely difficult, due to the intrinsic complexity of these architectures. Notwithstanding, the available literature does not yet offer sufficient experiences, nor significant methodologies, in such a direction. This paper presents a novel modeling approach, based on mean field analysis, a set of methods for approximate inference of probabilistic models, derived from statistical physics, for performance evaluation of big data systems. This approach, by containing the excessive state space growth characterizing more traditional modeling methodologies, also requires a significantly reduced effort with respect to simulation based ones. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is currently the most popular architecture style used in guiding development of IoT application systems. So far, there have been several architecture reference models based on SOA proposed for thing-centric IoT applications. In this paper, we make a comparative analysis on these reference models in terms of component type, design principle and structural characteristics. The results of comparison explain why these reference models are suitable for guiding design of IoT application systems with different scales and requirements. We also analyze ways to establish formal models and model check of IoT application systems based on these architecture reference models. Finally, we figure out some future work to be done to establish a software-architecture-based development method of IoT application systems.",

Given the increasing dependence upon such critical infrastructures, research and investments in identifying their vulnerabilities and devising survivability enhancements are recognized paramount by many countries. Understanding and analyzing interdependencies and interoperabilities between different critical infrastructures and between the several heterogeneous subsystems each infrastructure is composed of, are among the most challenging aspects faced today by designers, developers and operators in these critical sectors. Assessing the impact of interdependencies on the ability of the system to provide resilient and secure services is of primarily importance; following this analysis, steps can be taken to mitigate vulnerabilities revealed in critical assets. This paper addresses the analysis of CI, with focus on interdependencies between the involved subsystems. In particular, the experience gained by the authors in an on-going European project is reported and discussed, both in terms of identified challenges and in viable approaches under investigation.",

      "Abstract": "Managing inconsistencies between models is a key challenge in engineering processes of complex systems. Early detection of inconsistencies results in more efficient processes, because it can reduce the amount of re-execution of costly engineering activities. In this paper, we propose an approach for early inconsistency detection in engineering processes. In our approach, the engineering process is explicitly modeled, along with the important characteristics and constraints of the system, imposed by the requirements and system specifications. This information is then used to enact the process and augment it with a run-time consistency monitoring service. Inconsistencies are expressed as a satisfiability problem of the constraints. Early detection of inconsistencies is achieved by monitoring the constraints, that is, checking their satisfiability at specific points of the process. Our approach is supported with a framework which includes a visual process modeling tool, a process enactment engine and a state-of-the-art symbolic solver for early inconsistency detection.",

      "Abstract": "Large-scale model-driven engineering projects are carried out collaboratively. Enabling a high degree of concurrency is required to make the traditionally rigid development processes more agile. The increasing number of collaborators increases the probability of introducing conflicts which need to be resolved manually by the collaborators. In case of highly interdependent models, avoiding conflicts by the use of locks can save valuable time. However, traditional locking techniques such as fragment-based and object-based strategies may impose unnecessary restrictions on editing, which can decrease the efficiency of collaboration.In this paper, we propose a property-based locking approach that generalizes traditional locking techniques, and further allows more fine-grained locks in order to restrict modifications only when necessary. A lock is considered to be violated if a match appears or disappears for its associated graph pattern (formula), which captures the property of the model that the upcoming edit transaction can be freely executed. An initial evaluation has been carried out using a case study of the MONDO EU project.",

      "Abstract": "Design-Space Exploration (DSE) and optimization look for a suitable and optimal candidate solution to a problem, with respect to a set of quality criteria, by searching through a space of possible solution designs. Search-Based Optimization (SBO) is a well-known technique for design-space exploration and optimization. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) offers many benefits for creating a general approach to SBO, through a suitable problem representation. In MDE, model transformation is the preferred technique to manipulate models. The challenge thus lies in adapting model transformations to perform SBO tasks. In this paper, we demonstrate that multiple SBO techniques are easily incorporated into MDE. Through a non-trivial example of electrical circuit generation, we show how this approach can be applied, how it enables simple switching between different SBO approaches, and integrates domain knowledge, all within the modeling paradigm.",

      "Abstract": "Smart production aims to increase the flexibility of the production processes and be more efficient in the use of resources. Two important pillars of this initiative are \"smart products\" and \"smart factories\". From the perspective of product line engineering, these can be seen as two product lines (product line of factories and product line of goods) that need to be integrated for a common systems engineering approach. In this paper, we look at this problem from the perspective of configuration technologies, outline the research challenges in this area and illustrate our vision using an industrial example. The factory product line goes hand-in-hand with the product line of the products to be manufactured. Future research in product line engineering needs to consider an ecosystem of a multitude of stakeholders - e.g., factory component vendors, product designers, factory owners/operators and end-consumers.",

      "Abstract": "We present the tools, metamodels and code generation techniques in use at Elettronica SpA for the development of communication adapters for software and firmware systems from heterogeneous models. The process start from a SysML system model, developed according to the platform-based design (PBD) paradigm, in which a functional model of the system is paired to a model of the execution platform. Subsystems are refined as Simulink models or hand coded in C++. In turn, Simulink models are implemented as software code or firmware on FPGA, and an automatic generation of the implementation is obtained. Based on the SysML system architecture specification, our framework drives the generation of Simulink models with consistent interfaces, allows the automatic generation of the communication code among all subsystems (including the HW-FW interface code).",

      "Abstract": "In this article, the feasibility of a unified modelling and programming paradigm is discussed from the perspective of large scale system development and verification in collaborative development environments. We motivate the necessity to utilise multiple formalisms for development and verification, in particular for complex cyber-physical systems or systems of systems. Though modelling, programming, and verification will certainly become more closely integrated in the future, we do not expect a single formalism to become universally applicable and accepted by the development and verification communities. The multiformalism approach requires to translate verification artefacts (assertions, test cases, etc.) between different representations, in order to allow for the verification of emergent properties based on local verification results established with different methods and modelling techniques. It is illustrated by means of a case study from the railway domain, how this can be achieved, using concepts from the theory of institutions. This also enables the utilisation of verification tools in different formalisms, despite the fact that these tools are usually developed for one specific formal method.",

      "Abstract": "Batteries are nowadays ubiquitous in our everyday life but their role may certainly be even more important in the future. They are part of the technologies that should address the challenges of efficient devices for electric vehicles/large-scale grid storage while delivering clean sustainable energy. This book chapter reviews some of the exciting possibilities afforded in this area through the use of computer simulation techniques, focusing first on the scope of contemporary work calling to density functional theory calculations and then including an overview of the growing areas of multiphysics and multiscale modeling. The main information and progress that can be expected by using these methodologies encompass promoting design of new materials or devices thanks to prediction of average intercalation voltages and stability, understanding of structure-property relationships (analysis of electron density properties, band structures interpretation, etc.), studies of electron conductivity and ion diffusion processes, investigations on solid-electrolyte interphase layer, analyses of microstructural or thermomechanical stress properties and genesis of global multiphysics and multiscale modeling tools for gaining insights in the battery performance. Besides some comparison between intercalation and conversion batteries, a final focus is made on emerging battery types (e.g., lithium-air and all solid-state batteries).",

      "Title": "Stress-testing remote model querying APIs for relational and graph-based stores",
      "Abstract": "Recent research in scalable model-driven engineering now allows very large models to be stored and queried. Due to their size, rather than transferring such models over the network in their entirety, it is typically more efficient to access them remotely using networked services (e.g. model repositories, model indexes). Little attention has been paid so far to the nature of these services, and whether they remain responsive with an increasing number of concurrent clients. This paper extends a previous empirical study on the impact of certain key decisions on the scalability of concurrent model queries on two domains, using an Eclipse Connected Data Objects model repository, four configurations of the Hawk model index and a Neo4j-based configuration of the NeoEMF model store. The study evaluates the impact of the network protocol, the API design, the caching layer, the query language and the type of database and analyses the reasons for their varying levels of performance. The design of the API was shown to make a bigger difference compared to the network protocol (HTTP/TCP) used. Where available, the query-specific indexed and derived attributes in Hawk outperformed the comprehensive generic caching in CDO. Finally, the results illustrate the still ongoing evolution of graph databases: two tools using different versions of the same backend had very different performance, with one slower than CDO and the other faster than it.",

      "Abstract": "The lambda architectural pattern allows to overcome some limitations of data processing frameworks. It builds on the methodology of having two different data processing streams on the same system: a real time computing for fast data streams and a batch computing behavior for massive workloads for delayed processing. While these two modes are clearly not new, lambda architectures allow them to coordinate their execution to avoid interference. However resource allocation over cloud infrastructure, has greatly impacted the overall performances (and importantly costs). If performance could be modeled in advance, architects could make better judgments on allocation of their resources to use the systems more efficiently. In this paper, we present a modeling approach, based on multiformalism and multisolution techniques, that provides a fast evaluation tool to support design choices about parameters and eventually lead to better architecture designs.",

Here resilience refers to a 3S-oriented design, that is, stability, security, and systematicness: Stability means the CPS can achieve a stable sensing-actuation close-loop control even though the inputs (sensing data) have noise or attacks; Security means that the system can overcome the cyber-physical interaction attacks; and Systematicness means that the system has a seamless integration of sensors and actuators. We will also explain the CPS modeling issues since they serve as the basics of 3S design. We will use two detailed examples from our achieved projects to explain how to achieve arobust, systematic CPS design: Case study 1 is on the design of a rehabilitation system with cyber (sensors) and physical (robots) integration. Case Study 2 is on the implantable medical device design. It illustrates the nature of CPS security principle. The dominant feature of this survey is that it has both principle discussions and practical cyber-physical coupling design.",

The key of this feature relies on the SIMTHESys metamodel and the description framework that is founded onto it. This chapter presents the foundation of SIMTHESys formalisms and demonstrates the possibilities it offers by examining a complete modeling example of a classical problem and a number of different formalisms, chosen to suggest how to exploit the framework.",

The design, implementation, operation, maintenance and evolution of such systems require informed decisions, that must be founded onto techniques and tools enabling an anticipated knowledge about the behavior of every subsystem, including hardware, software and interactions, and the whole system, and the relationship of the system and the external world, considering workloads, communication, sensing of physical interactions. Performance prediction, and in general behavior prediction, may exploit simulation based approaches or analytical techniques to evaluate in advance the effects of design choices, or variability under different workloads, or emerging behavior, of systems, and provide a valuable support in all the phases of the lifecycle of a system by means of proper modeling approaches. In this Special Issue we present some contributions that offer a glance on modeling and evaluation of complex computer based system, and that have been chosen in order to provide a view on different domains and different approaches, mainly focusing on simulation techniques and related applications.",

      "Abstract": "A notion of hierarchical scope is commonplace in many programmatic systems. In the context of model, and in particular graph transformation, the use of scope can present two advantages: first, more natural expression of transformation application locality, and second, reduction in the number of match candidates, promising performance improvements. Previous work on scope, however, has focused on applying it to rule hierarchies, which reduces the number of matches performed, but not necessarily the cost of finding a single match. In this paper we define and explore a hierarchical scope formalism applied to the input graph, with associated modifications to the transformation rule definition. We then experimentally evaluate the benefits and challenges of our scoped model transformations in the state-of-the-art graph rewriting tool GrGen and our research-oriented, meta-modeling and rule-based model transformation tool AToMPM. We use a non-trivial “fire spreading” simulation transformation taken from distributed simulation community and a mutual exclusion transformation benchmark to demonstrate that integration of scope results in an elegant, intuitive, and efficient way of solving model transformation problems.",

      "Abstract": "Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) places models as first-class artifacts throughout the software lifecycle. In this context, model transformations are crucial for the success of MDE, being comparable in role and importance to compilers for high-level programming languages. Thus, several model transformation approaches have been developed in the last decade, whereby originally most of them are based on the abstract syntax of modeling languages. However, this implementation specific focus makes it difficult for modelers to develop model transformations, because they are familiar with the concrete syntax but not with its computer internal representation. To tackle this problem, model transformation by-example approaches have been proposed which follow the same fundamental idea as query by-example and programming by-example approaches. Instead of using the computer internal representation of models, examples represented in concrete syntax are used to define transformations. Because different transformation scenarios occur in MDE, different by-example approaches have been developed. This chapter gives an overview on the emerging concepts, techniques, and approaches in this young by-example area. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

      "Abstract": "Modelling is an important tool for understanding the complexity of forest ecosystems and the variety of interactions of ecosystem components, processes and values. This book describes the hybrid approach to modelling forest ecosystems and their possible response to natural and management-induced disturbance. The book describes the FORECAST family of ecosystem management models at three different spatial scales (tree, stand and landscape), and compares them with alternative models at these three spatial scales. The book will help forest managers to understand what to expect from ecosystem-based forest models; serve as a tool for use in teaching about sustainability, scenario analysis and value trade-offs in natural resources management; and assist policy makers, managers and researches working in assessment of sustainable forest management and ecosystem management. Several real-life examples of using the FORECAST family of models in forest management and other applications are presented from countries including Canada, China, Spain and the USA, to illustrate the concepts described in the text. The book also demonstrates how these models can be extended for scenario and value trade-off analysis through visualization and educational or management games.",

      "Abstract": "Efficient storage and querying of long-term human-robot interaction data requires application developers to have an in-depth understanding of the involved domains. It is an error prone task that can immensely impact the interaction experience of humans with robots and artificial agents. In the development cycle of HRI applications, queries towards storage solutions are often created once, copied into according components, and are rarely revisited. Beyond possible syntactical errors (especially impacting query design time), any change in the underlying storage solution structure results in semantic errors at run time which are not easy to spot in existing applications. To address this issue, we present a model-driven software development approach to create a long-term storage system to be used in highly interactive HRI scenarios. We created multiple domain specific languages that allow us to model the domain and seamlessly embed its concepts into a query language. Along with corresponding model-to-model and model-to-text transformations we generate a fully integrated workbench facilitating data storage and retrieval. It supports developers in the query design process and allows in-tool query execution without the need to have prior in-depth knowledge of the domain. We evaluated our work in an extensive user study and can show that the generated tool yields multiple advantages compared to the usual query design approach.",

While graph transformation is well-suited to describe the transformation of visual models, one can observe that models are often composite structures with visual, graphical and diagrammatic components accompanied by all kinds of data objects like strings, sets, numbers, etc. that are not adequately represented by graphs. We advocate algebraic specification to cover these parts of models and tupling to combine the graph and the data components.",

      "Abstract": "Growing amounts of data and the demand to process them within time constraints have led to the development of big data systems. A generic principle to design such systems that allows for low latency results is called the lambda architecture. It defines that data is analyzed twice by combining batch and stream processing techniques in order to provide a real time view. This redundant processing of data makes this architecture very expensive. In cases where process results are not continuously required to be low latency or time constraints lie within several minutes, a clear decision whether both processing layers are inevitable is not possible yet. Therefore, we propose stream processing on demand within the lambda architecture in order to efficiently use resources and reduce hardware investments. We use performance models as an analytical decision-making solution to predict response times of batch processes and to decide when to additionally deploy stream processes. By the example of a smart energy use case we implement and evaluate the accuracy of our proposed solution.",

Studies on SDN have brought a number of interesting technical discussions on network architecture design, along with scientific contributions. Researchers, network operators, and vendors are trying to establish new standards and provide guidelines for proper implementation and deployment of such novel approach. It is clear that many of these research efforts have been made in the southbound of the SDN architecture, while the northbound interface still needs improvements. By focusing in the SDN northbound, this paper surveys the body of knowledge and discusses the challenges for developing SDN software. We investigate the existing solutions and identify trends and challenges on programming for SDN environments. We also discuss future developments on techniques, specifications, and methodologies for programmable networks, with the orthogonal view from the software engineering discipline.",

      "Abstract": "Sound methodologies for constructing security-critical systems are extremely important in order to confront the increasingly varied security threats. As a response to this need, Model-Driven Security has emerged in the early 2000s as a specialized Model-Driven Engineering approach for supporting the development of security-critical systems.In this chapter we summarize the most important developments of Model-Driven Security during the past decade. In order to do so we start by building a taxonomy of the most important concepts of this domain. We then use our taxonomy to describe and evaluate a set of representative and influential Model-Driven Security approaches in the literature. In our development of this topic we concentrate on the concepts shared by Model-Driven Engineering and Model-Driven Security. This allows us to identify and debate the advantages, disadvantages, and open issues when applying Model-Driven Engineering to the Information Security domain.This chapter provides a broad view of Model-Driven Security and is intended as an introduction to Model-Driven Security for students, researchers, and practitioners. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",

      "Title": "Chapter 3 - Advances in Model-Driven Security",
      "Abstract": "This book comprehensively presents a novel approach to the systematic security hardening of software design models expressed in the standard UML language. It combines model-driven engineering and the aspect-oriented paradigm to integrate security practices into the early phases of the software development process. To this end, a UML profile has been developed for the specification of security hardening aspects on UML diagrams. In addition, a weaving framework, with the underlying theoretical foundations, has been designed for the systematic injection of security aspects into UML models. The work is organized as follows: chapter 1 presents an introduction to software security, model-driven engineering, UML and aspect-oriented technologies. Chapters 2 and 3 provide an overview of UML language and the main concepts of aspect-oriented modeling (AOM) respectively. Chapter 4 explores the area of model-driven architecture with a focus on model transformations. The main approaches that are adopted in the literature for security specification and hardening are presented in chapter 5. After these more general presentations, chapter 6 introduces the AOM profile for security aspects specification. Afterwards, chapter 7 details the design and the implementation of the security weaving framework, including several real-life case studies to illustrate its applicability. Chapter 8 elaborates an operational semantics for the matching/weaving processes in activity diagrams, while chapters 9 and 10 present a denotational semantics for aspect matching and weaving in executable models following a continuation-passing style. Finally, a summary and evaluation of the work presented are provided in chapter 11. The book will benefit researchers in academia and industry as well as students interested in learning about recent research advances in the field of software security engineering.",

      "Abstract": "Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is an umbrella approach that has been applied to a wide range of natural resource management situations. This paper has two purposes. First, it aims to provide a critical review of MCDA methods applied to forest and other natural resource management. The review seeks to layout the nature of the models, their inherent strengths and limitations. Models are categorized based on different classification schemes and are reviewed by describing their general characteristics, approaches, and fundamental properties. The review goes beyond traditional MCDA techniques; it describes new modelling approaches to forest management. The second purpose is to describe new MCDA paradigms aimed at addressing the inherent complexity of managing forest ecosystems, particularly with respect to multiple criteria, multi-stakeholders, and lack of information. Comments about, and critical analysis of, the limitations of traditional models are made to point out the need for, and propose a call to, a new way of thinking about MCDA as they are applied to forest and natural resource management planning. These new perspectives do not undermine the value of traditional methods; rather they point to a shift in emphasis-from methods for problem solving to methods for problem structuring. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This chapter provides a review of quality contracts, or more generally, those parts of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) which deal with statements about the services quality levels on which the service requestor and the providers have reached an agreement.

      "Title": "Simulation-Based Complex Adaptive Systems",
      "Abstract": "Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) are systems that display two primary characteristics: emergent behavior and adaptive behavior. Emergent behavior manifests in a system comprising of large number of components, often considered as agents, engaged in multi-level interactions. Adaptive behavior manifests at the agent-environment boundary when the agent situates itself in an environment. Modeling a CAS has been a challenge due to limitations in bringing these two aspects together in a single formal specification in a computational environment. Lack of simulation environment for a CAS model adds further problem in validation and verification of a CAS model. Computationally, the emergent behavior can be understood using today’s latest technology of Feature Engineering, Deep Learning and data analytics using Big Data. This would facilitate the identification of various holistic behaviors and their classification that would aid designing various observers for detecting the emergent behavior in a computational environment. This aspect is largely bottom-up. Once various observers are computationally available, they can be integrated in the agent behavior repertoire so that the emergent behavior, that is now detectable and perceivable at the agent-environment boundary, can be used and acted-upon by the agent. This situates the agent in the environment and manifests as adaptable behavior. This activity is top-down as there is a conscious design process (done by a human) that is employed for such behavior refinement. This chapter will discuss the state-of-the-art in computational and simulation support needed and provides foundation to manifest accurate emergent behavior in a computational environment as a means to perform CAS engineering.",

      "Title": "Requirement-driven evolution in software product lines: A systematic mapping study",
      "Abstract": "CONTEXT. Software Product Lines (SPLs) aim to support the development of a whole family of software products through systematic reuse of shared assets. As SPLs exhibit a long life-span, evolution is an even greater concern than for single-systems. For the purpose of this work, evolution refers to the adaptation of the SPL as a result of changing requirements. Hence, evolution is triggered by requirement changes, and not by bug fixing or refactoring. OBJECTIVE. Research on SPL evolution has not been previously mapped. This work provides a mapping study along Petersen's and Kichenham's guidelines, to identify strong areas of knowledge, trends and gaps. RESULTS. We identified 107 relevant contributions. They were classified according to four facets: evolution activity (e.g., identify, analyze and plan, implement), product-derivation approach (e.g., annotation-based, composition-based), research type (e.g., solution, experience, evaluation), and asset type (i.e., variability model, SPL architecture, code assets and products). CONCLUSION. Analyses of the results indicate that “Solution proposals” are the most common type of contribution (31%). Regarding the evolution activity, “Implement change” (43%) and “Analyze and plan change” (37%) are the most covered ones. A finer-grained analysis uncovered some tasks as being underexposed. A detailed description of the 107 papers is also included.",

Indeed, different components may be modeled by using the most suitable modeling formalism and multi-solution strategies may be applied to analyze the resulting multi-formalism model since no single solution method is adequate to solve all sub-models. In this paper we present the architecture of an extensible multi-formalism framework for the modeling and design of distributed dependable system. We show that the process needed to solve/analyze a model expressed through different formalisms may be described as it were a business process and executed by means of a workflow engine. We apply the proposed technique to a fault tolerant remote SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) system.",

      "Title": "Hybrid simulation studies and Hybrid Simulation systems: Definitions, challenges, and benefits",
      "Abstract": "Hybrid Simulation (HS) is not new. However there is contention in academic discourse as to what qualifies as HS? Is there a distinction between multi-method, multi-paradigm and HS? How do we integrate methods from disciplines like OR and computer science that contribute to the success of a M&S study? How do we validate a hybrid model when the whole (the combined model) is greater than the sum of its parts (the individual models)? Most dynamic simulations have a notion of time, how do we realize a unified representation of simulation time across methodologies, techniques and packages, and how do we prevent causality during inter-model message exchange? These are but some of the questions which we found to be asking ourselves frequently, and this panel paper provided a good opportunity to stimulate a discussion along these lines and to open it up to the M&S community.",

      "Title": "Model-based security engineering for cyber-physical systems: A systematic mapping study",
      "Abstract": "Context Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) have emerged to be the next generation of engineered systems driving the so-called fourth industrial revolution. CPSs are becoming more complex, open and more prone to security threats, which urges security to be engineered systematically into CPSs. Model-Based Security Engineering (MBSE) could be a key means to tackle this challenge via security by design, abstraction, and automation. Objective We aim at providing an initial assessment of the state of the art in MBSE for CPSs (MBSE4CPS). Specifically, this work focuses on finding out 1) the publication statistics of MBSE4CPS studies; 2) the characteristics of MBSE4CPS studies; and 3) the open issues of MBSE4CPS research. Method We conducted a systematic mapping study (SMS) following a rigorous protocol that was developed based on the state-of-the-art SMS and systematic review guidelines. From thousands of relevant publications, we systematically identified 48 primary MBSE4CPS studies for data extraction and synthesis to answer predefined research questions. Results SMS results show that for three recent years (2014–2016) the number of primary MBSE4CPS studies has increased significantly. Within the primary studies, the popularity of using Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) is comparable with the use of the standardised UML modelling notation. Most primary studies do not explicitly address specific security concerns (e.g., confidentiality, integrity) but rather focus on security analyses in general on threats, attacks or vulnerabilities. Few primary studies propose to engineer security solutions for CPSs. Many focus on the early stages of development lifecycle such as security requirement engineering or analysis. Conclusion The SMS does not only provide the state of the art in MBSE4CPS, but also points out several open issues that would deserve more investigation, e.g., the lack of engineering security solutions for CPSs, limited tool support, too few industrial case studies, and the challenge of bridging DSLs in engineering secure CPSs.",

      "Title": "The analysis of architectural languages for the needs of practitioners",
      "Abstract": "Architectural languages (ALs) have attracted much attention as the modeling notations for specifying and reasoning about important design decisions. In this study, 124 different existing ALs have been analyzed for a set of requirements that are crucial for practitioners. These requirements are concerned with language definition, language features, and tool support. Some of the important findings obtained from the analysis are as follows: (1) performance is the top popular nonfunctional requirement supported by ALs; (2) no ALs offer both textual and visual notation sets, one of which could be used independently; (3) process algebras are the top preferred formal method by formal ALs; (4) the physical, deployment, and operational viewpoints are rarely supported by ALs; (5) the top preferred extension mechanism of the extensible ALs is XML for syntax extension; (6) Java is the top preferred programming language in generating software code; (7) the exhaustive model checking is the top preferred automated analysis method; (8) the logic-based formal techniques are so popular in specifying system requirements; (9) among the analysis properties considered, consistency is the top supported property for the automated checking; and (10) most ALs do not provide any discussion platform (eg, forums). Hence, these findings can be used by the new AL developers in addressing the needs of practitioners and bridging the gaps in the field. Practitioners can also use the findings to find out about the existing ALs and compare them to choose the one(s) that suits their needs best.",

      "Abstract": "Embedded systems, with their tight technology integration, and multiple requirements and stakeholders, are characterized by tightly interrelated processes, information and tools. Embedded systems will as a consequence be described by multiple, heterogeneous and interrelated descriptions such as for example requirements documents, design and analysis models, software and hardware descriptions. We refer to a system designed this way as a multi-view (MV) system. The main contribution of this paper is a characterization of model-based approaches to MV systems. The characterization takes three main perspectives for the relations between viewpoints: semantic relations (content), relations over time (process), and manipulation of views (operations). We complement these perspectives by investigating MV system challenges and by a survey of related approaches. The characterization aims to provide a basis for a better understanding, design and implementation of MV systems, and thereby to overcome the current fragmented points of view on integrated multi-view modeling (MVM).",

We discuss tools and methods for creating Web of Things services, in particular mashup tools as well as model-driven engineering approaches. While mashup tools mainly focus on modeling the data flow and rapid development, model-driven engineering approaches permit different views and more expressive modeling concepts. We analyze both concepts and techniques regarding expressiveness, suitability for the problem domain as well as ease of use and scalability. Then, we discuss how mashup tools can be extended based on model-driven engineering concepts, while preserving the advantages of simplicity and ease of use. In particular, we show how mashup tools can be extended to more flexible, generic operations on sets of things, based on advanced modeling concepts.",

      "Abstract": "Model transformations are at the heart of model-driven engineering because they allow the automation of diverse kinds of model manipulations. Transformation scheduling is a key issue in the design and implementation of many transformation languages. This paper reports our results using continuations as the underlying technique for building a scheduling mechanism implicitly driven by data dependence among transformation rules. To support our experiments, we have built a proof-of-concept model transformation language, which is also reported here. First, we motivate the problem by analyzing the scheduling mechanism of current model transformation languages. Then, we introduce the notion of continuation, showing its applicability to model transformations. Afterwards, we present our approach, notably explaining how dependence is specified and giving the scheduling algorithm. We also analyze the lazy resolution of rules and how to deal with collection operations. The approach is validated by an implementation that targets the Java Virtual Machine and by running of the performance benchmarks that show its efficiency and scalability. Besides, we discuss how it can be applied to other existing transformation languages and present several applicability scenarios.",

      "Abstract": "Task Models (TMs) that can adapt to context are a state-of-the-art executable modeling language that has proven to be successful in the automation and support of daily user tasks in pervasive systems. TMs are intuitive and easy to use to design such systems, however, they do not provide any verification technique for ensuring their correctness. To enable verification checking, we investigate and define mappings that can translate TMs to Context-Adaptive Petri Nets (CAPNs). CAPN is a recently proposed formalism to support Petri Nets (PNs) that take into account their execution context. Using PN as a base, CAPN provides powerful techniques for behavior simulation and verification. By applying the defined mappings, pervasive system's behavior can be intuitively represented using task models and then translated to their equivalent CAPNs. These CAPNs can be then used to perform an exhaustive checking of the represented behavior at design time in order to ensure a proper and safe system execution at runtime.",

      "Abstract": "Emergency response is a knowledge-intensive process that is very hard to model and automate. This primarily returns to the unpredictability and unrepeatability nature that characterises such process. Traditional modelling approaches are too rigid and do not effectively support the flexibility and dynamicity required by emergency response process. Case Management Model and Notation (CMMN) is a new standard modelling specification that has recently been released by Object Management Group (OMG) to standardise the modelling of Case Management approach. The objective of this study is to demonstrate how the CMMN can be used to model emergency response process. The authors use the CMMN to build a template model for a generic emergency response process. This model can easily be extended or interchanged among different modelling tools or execution platforms. In addition, they present a case study of a flood management process as a concrete example of using CMMN in modelling emergency response process. Finally, they conclude that the CMMN has a great potential to model case-based processes such as emergency response, but CMMN still in its infancy. As a result, there is a lack of mature modelling tools and execution engines to execute the CMMN models.",

However, this emphasis on flashy, technology-driven design can come with a cost: the sacrifice of practical utility, which, in the high-stakes environment of military aviation, can lead directly to catastrophe. Mission Adaptive Display Technologies and Operational Decision Making in Aviation explores the use of adaptive and assistive technologies in aviation to establish clear guidelines for the design and implementation of such technologies to better serve the needs of both military and civilian pilots. Benefiting from the authors' combined experience of more than 40 years in the aviation industry and over 25,000 flight-hours, this volume targets a wide audience of engineers and business professionals. This premier reference source covers topics of interest to aviators and engineers, including aerodynamic systems design, operational decision theory, user interface design, avionics, and concepts and cases in flight operations, mission performance, and pilot training.",

      "Abstract": "In semiconductor manufacturing, wafer quality control strongly relies on product monitoring and physical metrology. However, the involved metrology operations, generally performed by means of scanning electron microscopes, are particularly cost-intensive and time-consuming. For this reason, in common practice a small subset only of a productive lot is measured at the metrology stations and it is devoted to represent the entire lot. Virtual Metrology (VM) methodologies are used to obtain reliable predictions of metrology results at process time, without actually performing physical measurements. This goal is usually achieved by means of statistical models and by linking process data and context information to target measurements. Since semiconductor manufacturing processes involve a high number of sequential operations, it is reasonable to assume that the quality features of a given wafer (such as layer thickness and critical dimensions) depend on the whole processing and not on the last step before measurement only. In this paper, we investigate the possibilities to enhance VM prediction accuracy by exploiting the knowledge collected in the previous process steps. We present two different schemes of multi-step VM, along with dataset preparation indications. Special emphasis is placed on regression techniques capable of handling high-dimensional input spaces. The proposed multi-step approaches are tested on industrial production data.",

      "Abstract": "The objective of feature modeling is to foster software reuse by enabling to explicitly and abstractly express commonality and variability in the domain. Feature modeling alone is not sufficient to express all the aspects of the software being developed. Other models and, eventually, code is necessary. These software assets are being configured by the feature model based on the selection of variable features. However, selecting a feature is far from a naive component based approach where feature inclusion would simply mean including the corresponding component. More often than not, feature inclusion affects several places in models or code to be configured requiring their nontrivial adaptation. Feature inclusion recalls transformation and this is at heart of the approach to feature model driven generation of software artifacts proposed in this paper. Features are viewed as solution space transformations that may be executed during the generative process conducted by the feature model configuration.",

The history of Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) simulation and Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) are reviewed in the context of their respective roles in the development of complex engineered systems. The combination of HIL and MBSE is then proposed as a paradigm shift in the way design is performed, bringing valuable information early to the designer. However, there is much work to be done in understanding how to combine these two concepts and how to handle the information that would be generated. It is on the shoulders of both academia and industry to tackle different elements of this problem, as one entity acting alone will not effectively solve it. If history is a guide, industry will tend to linearly grow capabilities of existing toolsets to support existing customer bases. Academia will explore innovative approaches in the laboratory which may be of little practical use in industry. Research to determine the best way to integrate the total systems viewpoint and system effectiveness aspects of MBSE with the HIL simulation aspects of virtual HIL toolsets will bring those capabilities to bear jointly on complex engineered systems sooner and more effectively.",

      "Abstract": "Multi-Paradigm Modelling (MPM) is a research field focused on solving the challenge of combining, coupling, and integrating rigorous models of some reality, at different levels of abstraction and views, using adequate modelling formalisms and semantic domains, with the goal to simulate (for optimization) or realize systems that may be physical, software or a combination of both. The key challenges are finding adequate Model Abstractions, Multi-formalism modelling, Model Transformation and the application of MPM techniques and tools to Complex Systems. MPM theories/methods/technologies have been successfully applied in the field of software architectures, control system design, model integrated computing, and tool interoperability. The fourth Workshop on Multi-Paradigm Modelling: Concepts and Tools (MPM) was held this year (2010) in Oslo. It is usually organized as a satellite event of MoDELS aimed to further the state-of-the-art as well as to define future directions of this emerging research area by bringing together world experts in the field for an intense one-day workshop.

      "Abstract": "Automated model generation can be highly beneficial for various application scenarios including software tool certification, validation of cyber-physical systems or benchmarking graph databases to avoid tedious manual synthesis of models. In the paper, we present a long-term research challenge how to generate graph models specific to a domain which are consistent, diverse, scalable and realistic at the same time. We provide foundations for a class of model generators along a refinement relation which operates over partial models with 3-valued representation and ensures that subsequently derived partial models preserve the truth evaluation of well-formedness constraints in the domain. We formally prove completeness, i.e. any finite instance model of a domain can be generated by model generator transformations in finite steps and soundness, i.e. any instance model retrieved as a solution satisfies all well-formedness constraints. An experimental evaluation is carried out in the context of a statechart modeling tool to evaluate the trade-off between different characteristics of model generators.",

      "Title": "Projecting a Modular Future",
      "Abstract": "Two innovations are enhancing programming languages' capabilities. First, modularity lets you combine independently developed languages without changing their respective definitions. A language is no longer a fixed quantity; you can extend it with domain-specific constructs as needed. Second, projectional editing lets you build editors and IDEs that don't require parsers. Such editors and IDEs support a range of tightly integrated notations, including textual, symbolic, tabular, and graphical notations. In addition, by avoiding parsers, they avoid grammar composition's well-known limitations. Three examples illustrate how these two innovations affect programming-language design. A set of modular extensions of C for embedded programming enables efficient code generation and formal analysis. A language for requirements engineering flexibly combines structured and unstructured (prose) data. Finally, a language for defining insurance rules uses mathematical notation. These examples all rely on the open source JetBrains MPS (Meta Programming System) language workbench. This article is part of a special issue on Software Architecture.",

      "Title": "Challenges in preserving intent comprehensibility in software",
      "Abstract": "Software is not only difficult to create, but it is also difficult to understand. Even the authors themselves in a relatively short time become unable to readily interpret their own code and to explain what intent they have followed by it. Software is being created with the goal to satisfy the needs of a customer or directly of the end users. Out of these needs comes the intent, which is relatively well understandable to all stakeholders. By using other specialized modeling techniques (typically the UML language) or in the code itself, use cases and other high-level specification and analytical artifacts in common software development almost completely dissolve. Along with dedicated initiatives to improve preserving intent comprehensibility in software, such as literate programming, intentional programming, aspect-oriented programming, or the DCI (Data, Context and Interaction) approach, this issue is a subject of contemporary research in the re-revealed area of engaging end users in software development, which has its roots in Alan Kay's vision of a personal computer programmable by end users. From the perspective of the reality of complex software system development, the existing approaches are solving the problem of losing intent comprehensibility only partially by a simplified and limited perception of the intent and do this only at the code level. This paper explores the challenges in preserving the intent comprehensibility in software. The thorough treatment of this problem requires a number of techniques and approaches to be engaged, including preserving use cases in the code, dynamic code structuring, executable intent representation using domain specific languages, advanced UML modularization, 3D rendering of UML, and representation and animation of organizational patterns.",

      "Title": "Features as transformations: A generative approach to software development",
      "Abstract": "The objective of feature modeling is to foster software reuse by enabling to explicitly and abstractly express commonality and variability in the domain. Feature modeling is used to configure other models and, eventually, code. These software assets are being configured by the feature model based on the selection of variable features. However, selecting a feature is far from a naive component based approach where feature inclusion would simply mean including the corresponding component. More often than not, feature inclusion affects several places in models or code to be configured requiring their nontrivial adaptation. Thus, feature inclusion recalls transformation and this is at heart of the approach to feature model driven generation of software artifacts proposed in this paper. Features are viewed as transformations that may be executed during the generative process conducted by the feature model configuration. The generative process is distributed in respective transformations enabling the developers to have a better control over it. This approach can be applied to modularize changes in product customization and to establish generative software product lines by gradual refactoring of existing products.",

      "Abstract": "The KAOS framework aims to avoid eliciting ambiguous or irrelevant requirements and allows efficient and easy communication between stakeholders. Nevertheless, KAOS is designed mainly for requirements engineers, not so much for other important stakeholders, that understand better other kinds of models, such as mind maps. Thus, this paper proposes an approach for generating KAOS goal models from mind maps by adopting model-driven techniques. The use of mind maps, as a creative and agile requirements technique, aims to encourage the construction of KAOS goal models more effectively and in a simpler way by involving all kinds of stakeholders that do need to know about KAOS. Our approach also contains the definition of a systematic process and is applied to an industrial case application.",

      "Abstract": "With the prevalence of net-centric environments, Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs) have emerged as a paradigm that greatly impacts the modeling and simulation (M&S) community. This paper has two interrelated goals. The first is to give a comprehensive review of various service-oriented simulation frameworks to help researchers select the appropriate one for their specific purpose. The second goal is to combine the common features derived from the review into one unifying framework that can describe and prescribe various specific approaches. The focus of this paper is on the common functionalities of service-oriented simulations reflected in the review and unifying framework. In particular, we emphasize the way SOAs and M&S are combined, and the interoperability and composability challenges of distributed M&S services. We describe some fundamental concepts first. Then we present a comprehensive survey of several classical frameworks, including formalism-based, model-driven, interoperability protocol based, eXtensible Modeling and Simulation Framework (XMSF), Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) based, and ontology-driven frameworks. Based on the review, we propose a novel three-dimensional reference model that can unify the ad hoc approaches into a common framework. The model can be used as a guideline or an analytic means to find potential and possible future directions. In particular, the model inspects the crossover between the disciplines of M&S, service-orientation, and software/systems engineering. Based on the model, we present a detailed comparison of the reviewed frameworks. Finally the significance of the paper is discussed and future directions are recommended. © 2011, SAGE Publications.

      "Abstract": "The performance of software algorithms can be improved by performing those algorithms on specialized embedded hardware. However, complex algorithms that rely on input data at runtime for configuration have a combinatorial explosion of possible configurations, which has historically put hardware acceleration out of reach for applications wishing to serve large configuration spaces. Data adaptable embedded systems overcome this limitation by allowing for hardware reconfiguration during runtime, but the complexity of the specification of these systems is difficult to manage with traditional techniques. In this paper, a modeling approach is discussed in order to concurrently model two aspects of the final system: dependencies between algorithm tasks, and desired hardware configurations for each task. The contribution of the work is the model-based generation of hardware and software tasks, as well as a control scheme customized to each model that oversees the dynamic reconfiguration process.",

      "Abstract": "It is a basic method to establish Internet of Things (IoT) by interconnecting all existing physical applications. However, there has not yet been an effective architecture to guide horizontal interconnections of physical applications. To address the problem, this paper proposes a Physical Model Driven software Architecture for Internet of Things (PMDA), which supports the horizontal interconnections of physical applications. PMDA is composed of three models, namely, Physical Model, Sense-Execute Model and Application Model. The connections and interactions between models, and interactions among components in the models are realized by connectors, which satisfies some certain constraints. The composition of the three models in PMDA and the interactions among the models are formally described by an Architecture Description Language named Wright. The effectiveness of horizontal interconnections of physical applications based on PMDA is verified by PAT, in terms of deadlock-free, divergence-free and nonterminating. Besides that, those properties of IoT application systems developed under guidance of PMDA are proven by mathematical induction.",

      "Title": "Improving verification accuracy of CPS by modeling and calibrating interaction uncertainty",
      "Abstract": "Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) intrinsically combine hardware and physical systems with software and network, which are together creating complex and correlated interactions. CPS applications often experience uncertainty in interacting with environment through unreliable sensors. They can be faulty and exhibit runtime errors if developers have not considered environmental interaction uncertainty adequately. Existing work in verifying CPS applications ignores interaction uncertainty and thus may overlook uncertainty-related faults. To improve verification accuracy, in this article we propose a novel approach to verifying CPS applications with explicit modeling of uncertainty arisen in the interaction between them and the environment. Our approach builds an Interactive State Machine network for a CPS application and models interaction uncertainty by error ranges and distributions. Then it encodes both the application and uncertainty models to Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) formula to leverage SMT solvers searching for counterexamples that represent application failures. The precision of uncertainty model can affect the verification results. However, it may be difficult to model interaction uncertainty precisely enough at the beginning, because of the uncontrollable noise of sensors and insufficient data sample size. To further improve the accuracy of the verification results, we propose an approach to identifying and calibrating imprecise uncertainty models. We exploit the inconsistency between the counterexamples' estimate and actual occurrence probabilities to identify possible imprecision in uncertainty models, and the calibration of imprecise models is to minimize the inconsistency, which is reduced to a Search-Based Software Engineering problem. We experimentally evaluated our verification and calibration approaches with real-world CPS applications, and the experimental results confirmed their effectiveness and efficiency.",

      "Title": "Panel: The future of research in modeling amp; simulation",
      "Abstract": "A Regional Climate Model (RCM), MM5 (the Fifth Generation Pennsylvania State University/National Center for Atmospheric Research mesoscale model), is used to simulate summer precipitation in Central Alberta. MM5 was set up with a one-way, three-domain nested framework, with domain resolutions of 27, 9, and 3. km, respectively, and forced with ERA-Interim reanalysis data of ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts). The objective is to develop high resolution, grid-based Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves based on the simulated annual maximums of precipitation (AMP) data for durations ranging from 15-min to 24-h. The performance of MM5 was assessed in terms of simulated rainfall intensity, precipitable water, and 2-m air temperature. Next, the grid-based IDF curves derived from MM5 were compared to IDF curves derived from six RCMs of the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) set up with 50-km grids, driven with NCEP-DOE (National Centers for Environmental Prediction-Department of Energy) Reanalysis II data, and regional IDF curves derived from observed rain gauge data (RG-IDF). The analyzed results indicate that 6-h simulated precipitable water and 2-m temperature agree well with the ERA-Interim reanalysis data. However, compared to RG-IDF curves, IDF curves based on simulated precipitation data of MM5 are overestimated especially for IDF curves of 2-year return period. In contract, IDF curves developed from NARCCAP data suffer from under-estimation and differ more from RG-IDF curves than the MM5 IDF curves. The over-estimation of IDF curves of MM5 was corrected by a quantile-based, bias correction method. By dynamically downscale the ERA-Interim and after bias correction, it is possible to develop IDF curves useful for regions with limited or no rain gauge data. This estimation process can be further extended to predict future grid-based IDF curves subjected to possible climate change impacts based on climate change projections of GCMs (general circulation models) of IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

      "Title": "A comparative evaluation of the effectiveness of virtual reality, 3D visualization and 2D visual interactive simulation: an exploratory meta-analysis",
      "Abstract": "Research on the application of 3D visualization and virtual reality (VR) in discrete-event simulation (DES) has received increased attention in the past two decades. The increasing popularity of the 3D display in DES is mainly due to superior display capabilities and the associated benefits that it offers. However, the 2D display also continues to enjoy active use to date, thus provoking some fierce debates questioning the need for the 3D and VR if the 2D interface suffices. Several studies comparing the effectiveness of the different visualization methods also produce different conclusions. This paper undertakes a meta-analysis of the different positions and synthesizes the findings from 162 studies on the impacts of the 2D display versus 3D/VR on user performance on various DES tasks. The results highlight four key findings. First, the perception that the 2D display is more effective for model development is misleading as 3D/VR offers overall better performance and quality of models. Second, 3D/VR enables more effective performance than 2D display for model verification and validation. Third, 3D/VR decreases the time taken for verification, validation, experimentation, and analysis of results, but can increase model development time. Finally, the latent variables such as the application domains and nature of the problems tackled have no direct or indirect influence on the efficacy of the 3D display/VR versus 2D on DES task performance.",

      "Title": "Benchmarking bidirectional transformations: theory, implementation, application, and assessment",
      "Abstract": "Bidirectional transformations (bx) are relevant for a wide range of application domains. While bx problems may be solved with unidirectional languages and tools, maintaining separate implementations of forward and backward synchronizers with mutually consistent behavior can be difficult, laborious, and error-prone. To address the challenges involved in handling bx problems, dedicated languages and tools for bx have been developed. Due to their heterogeneity, however, the numerous and diverse approaches to bx are difficult to compare, with the consequence that fundamental differences and similarities are not yet well understood. This motivates the need for suitable benchmarks that facilitate the comparison of bx approaches. This paper provides a comprehensive treatment of benchmarking bx, covering theory, implementation, application, and assessment. At the level of theory, we introduce a conceptual framework that defines and classifies architectures of bx tools. At the level of implementation, we describe Benchmarx, an infrastructure for benchmarking bx tools which is based on the conceptual framework. At the level of application, we report on a wide variety of solutions to the well-known Families-to-Persons benchmark, which were developed and compared with the help of Benchmarx. At the level of assessment, we reflect on the usefulness of the Benchmarx approach to benchmarking bx, based on the experiences gained from the Families-to-Persons benchmark.",

      "Abstract": "Car-navigation system was recently established as an imperative utility for modern navigation on road networks. The rising wave of self-driving cars along with an increasing demand for real-time traffic data is expected to generate massive growth of routing requests and processing time on large graphs representing the urban networks. Therefore, larger and more powerful computing infrastructures are required. In the context of smart cities, new, dynamic solutions are needed to deliver high-quality car-navigation services, powered by municipal traffic-monitoring data, capable of handling such a vast expected demand with reasonable employment of financial resources. In this work, we introduce an adaptive car-navigation system and its performance model used to tune the size of the computing infrastructure as a function of the characteristics of the environment considered. The model has been validated for a smart city environment using the data collected on the Milan urban area.",

      "Title": "Usability driven DSL development with USE-ME",
      "Abstract": "The adoption of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) is regarded as an approach to reduce the accidental complexity of software systems development. The availability of sophisticated language workbenches facilitates the development of DSLs making them increasingly more popular. The adoption of DSLs at large comes at the risk that a poorly designed DSL can be too hard to adopt by its domain users. As such, Usability is one of the essential characteristics to mitigate this risk as it has an important impact on the productivity achieved by DSL users. The current state of practice in Software Language Engineering (SLE) neglects the Usability of DSLs. A pertinent research question in SLE is how to engineer Usability into DSLs systematically. We argue that a timely systematic approach based on User Interface experimental evaluation techniques should be used to assess the impact of DSLs during their development process, while the cost of fixing the usability problems is relatively small, when compared to fixing them at the end of the development process. For that purpose, we introduce a conceptual framework, called USE-ME, which supports the iterative incremental development process of DSLs concerning the issue of their Usability evaluation. We illustrate the feasibility of the approach on a case study of the development of a DSL meant for children to program robots.",

DSE Merge aims to efficiently merge model versions created by various collaborators using search-based exploration of solution candidates that represent conflict-free merged models guided by domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we report how we systematically evaluated the efficiency of the DSE Merge technique from the user point of view using a reactive experimental Software engineering approach. The empirical tests included the involvement of the intended end users (i.e. engineers), namely undergraduate students, which were expected to confirm the impact of design decisions. In particular, we asked users to merge the different versions of the same model using DSE Merge when compared to using Diff Merge. The experiment showed that to use DSE Merge participant required lower cognitive effort, and expressed their preference and satisfaction with it.",

      "Abstract": "Good domain-modeling enables an appropriate separation of concerns that improves quality properties in the simulation models, such as modifiability and maintainability. In this paper, the interplay of abstraction and concreteness in advancing the theory and practice of Modelling and Simulation is improved using the Model-Driven Engineering levels for building simulation models devoted to routing processes. The definition of this type of processes is detailed as a domain-model conceived as an abstraction defined in a graph model. Such abstraction turns into a set of formal simulation models that are (later) translated into an executable implementation. The final simulation models are specified using Routed DEVS formalism. The methodological proposal is accomplished with the development of a Modelling and Simulation graphical software tool that uses the set of models (defined in terms of the Model-Driven Engineering approach) as the core of its operation. This graphical software tool is developed as a plug-in for Eclipse Integrated Development Environment with aims to take advantage of existent Modeling and Simulation software. Therefore, the usefulness of graphical modeling for supporting the development of the simulation models is empowered with a Model-Driven Engineering process. The main benefit obtained when the Model-Driven Engineering approach is used for modeling an abstraction of the final simulation model is a clear reduction of formalization and implementation times.",

      "Abstract": "It is claimed that, in the nascent ‘Cognitive Era’, intelligent systems will be trained using machine learning techniques rather than programmed by software developers. A contrary point of view argues that machine learning has limitations, and, taken in isolation, cannot form the basis of autonomous systems capable of intelligent behaviour in complex environments. In this paper, we explore the contributions that agent-oriented programming can make to the development of future intelligent systems. We briefly review the state of the art in agent programming, focussing particularly on BDI-based agent programming languages, and discuss previous work on integrating AI techniques (including machine learning) in agent-oriented programming. We argue that the unique strengths of BDI agent languages provide an ideal framework for integrating the wide range of AI capabilities necessary for progress towards the next-generation of intelligent systems. We identify a range of possible approaches to integrating AI into a BDI agent architecture. Some of these approaches, e.g., ‘AI as a service’, exploit immediate synergies between rapidly maturing AI techniques and agent programming, while others, e.g., ‘AI embedded into agents’ raise more fundamental research questions, and we sketch a programme of research directed towards identifying the most appropriate ways of integrating AI capabilities into agent programs.",

      "Abstract": "When dealing with complex systems, information is very often fragmented across many different models expressed within a variety of (modeling) languages. To provide the relevant information in an appropriate way to different kinds of stakeholders, (parts of) such models have to be combined and potentially revamped by focusing on concerns of particular interest for them. Thus, mechanisms to define and compute views over models are highly needed. Several approaches have already been proposed to provide (semi)automated support for dealing with such model views. This paper provides a detailed overview of the current state of the art in this area. To achieve this, we relied on our own experiences of designing and applying such solutions in order to conduct a literature review on this topic. As a result, we discuss the main capabilities of existing approaches and propose a corresponding research agenda. We notably contribute a feature model describing what we believe to be the most important characteristics of the support for views on models. We expect this work to be helpful to both current and potential future users and developers of model view techniques, as well as to any person generally interested in model-based software and systems engineering.",

      "Abstract": "Precisely when the success of artificial intelligence (AI) sub-symbolic techniques makes them be identified with the whole AI by many non-computer-scientists and non-technical media, symbolic approaches are getting more and more attention as those that could make AI amenable to human understanding. Given the recurring cycles in the AI history, we expect that a revamp of technologies often tagged as “classical AI”—in particular, logic-based ones—will take place in the next few years. On the other hand, agents and multi-agent systems (MAS) have been at the core of the design of intelligent systems since their very beginning, and their long-term connection with logic-based technologies, which characterised their early days, might open new ways to engineer explainable intelligent systems. This is why understanding the current status of logic-based technologies for MAS is nowadays of paramount importance. Accordingly, this paper aims at providing a comprehensive view of those technologies by making them the subject of a systematic literature review (SLR). The resulting technologies are discussed and evaluated from two different perspectives: the MAS and the logic-based ones.",

However, due to the lack of knowledge about the operation of the smart controllers, the occupants can unintentionally increase the energy spent. Nevertheless, there is evidence that the informed and motivated user will actually cooperate with the system. Some of the issues associated with researching control systems in the context of building automation are difficult to address, because of the chronic lack of effective laboratory settings for experimentation. In this paper, we describe a system representative of the usual complexity found in cyber-physical systems, whose purpose is to address the needs for experimenting with building automation, with a focus on control systems and gamification. Designed with pragmatic concerns, this system presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities to research a new generation of software control systems, and supporting interfaces, that leverage the occupants' behaviour.",

      "Title": "Multi-Paradigm Modelling for Cyber-Physical Systems: Foundations",
      "Abstract": "Modeling and analysis of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is an inherently multi-disciplinary endeavour. Anyone starting in this field will unavoidably face the need for a literature reference that delivers solid foundations. Although, in specific disciplines, many techniques are used already as a matter of standard practice, their fundamentals and application are typically far from practitioners of another area. Overall, practitioners tend to use the technique that they are most familiar with, disregarding others that would be adequate for the problem at hand. The inherent cross-disciplinary nature of CPS requires distinct modelling techniques to be employed, thus prompting for a common background formalism that enables communication between all specialities. However, to this date, no such single super-formalism exists to support the multiple dimensions of the design of a CPS. Indeed, to effectively design a CPS, engineers (in the role of modellers) either need to be versed in multiple formalisms, or a fundamentally new modelling approach has to emerge. Herein, we motivate Multi-Paradigm Modelling of CPS (MPM4CPS), introducing fundamental definitions and terminology regarding CPS modelling and Multi-Paradigm, and finally, laying the ground for the rest of the book.",

This modelling branch, so-called multi-view software and system modelling, praises a differentiated and complex scientific body of knowledge. With this study, we aimed at identifying, classifying, and evaluating existing solutions for multi-view modelling of software and systems. To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review of the existing state of the art related to the topic. More specifically, we selected and analysed 40 research studies among over 8600 entries. We defined a taxonomy for characterising solutions for multi-view modelling and applied it to the selected studies. Lastly, we analysed and discussed the data extracted from the studies. From the analysed data, we made several observations, among which: (i) there is no uniformity nor agreement in the terminology when it comes to multi-view artefact types, (ii) multi-view approaches have not been evaluated in industrial settings and (iii) there is a lack of support for semantic consistency management and the community does not appear to consider this as a priority. The study results provide an exhaustive overview of the state of the art for multi-view software and systems modelling useful for both researchers and practitioners.",

      "Title": "Architecture optimization: speed or accuracy? both!",
      "Abstract": "Embedded systems are becoming more and more complex, thus demanding innovative means to tame their challenging development. Among others, early architecture optimization represents a crucial activity in the development of embedded systems to maximise the usage of their limited resources and to respect their real-time requirements. Typically, architecture optimization seeks good architecture candidates based on model-based analysis. Leveraging abstractions and estimates, this analysis usually produces approximations useful for comparing architecture candidates. Nonetheless, approximations do not provide enough accuracy in estimating crucial extra-functional properties. In this article, we provide an architecture optimization framework that profits from both the speed of model-based predictions and the accuracy of execution-based measurements. Model-based optimization rapidly finds a good architecture candidate, which is refined through optimization based on monitored executions of automatically generated code. Moreover, the framework enables the developer to leverage her optimization experience. More specifically, the developer can use runtime monitoring of generated code execution to manually adjust task allocation at modeling level, and commit the changes without halting execution. In the article, our architecture optimization mechanism is first described from a general point of view and then exploited for optimizing the allocation of software tasks to the processing cores of a multicore embedded system; we target extra-functional properties that can be concretely represented and automatically compared for different architectural alternatives (such as memory consumption, energy consumption, or response-time).",

      "Abstract": "Several research efforts from different areas have focused on the execution of UML models, resulting in a diverse and complex scientific body of knowledge. With this work, we aim at identifying, classifying, and evaluating existing solutions for the execution of UML models. We conducted a systematic review in which we selected 63 research studies and 19 tools among over 5400 entries by applying a systematic search and selection process. We defined a classification framework for characterizing solutions for UML model execution, and we applied it to the 82 selected entries. Finally, we analyzed and discussed the obtained data. From the analyzed data, we drew the following conclusions: (i) There is a growing scientific interest on UML model execution; (ii) solutions providing translational execution clearly outnumber interpretive solutions; (iii) model-level debugging is supported in very few cases; (iv) only a few research studies provide evidence of industrial use, with very limited empirical evaluations; (v) the most common limitation deals with coverage of the UML language. Based on these observations, we discuss potential research challenges and implications for the future of UML model execution. Our results provide a concise overview of states of the art and practice for UML model execution intended for use by both researchers and practitioners.",

      "Abstract": "This theme section aims to disseminate the latest trends in the use and combination of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE). On the one hand, MDE aims to increase productivity in the development of complex systems while reducing the time to market. On the other hand, CBSE aims to deliver and then support the exploitation of reusable “off-the-shelf” software components that can be incorporated into larger applications. An effective interplay of MDE and CBSE can yield benefits to both communities: the CBSE community would benefit from implementation and automation capabilities of MDE, the MDE community would benefit from the foundational nature of CBSE. In total, we accepted three submissions for publication in the theme section after a thorough peer-reviewing process.",

      "Abstract": "We are having seasons: summers and winters of many scientific disciplines. Many fields are experiencing hype cycles. Each one of us would remember “AI winter” from the history of Artificial Intelligence. Inflated expectations are followed by disappointment and eventually funding cuts. Renewing the interest takes then years if not decades. The Society for Modeling and Simulation International has achieved outstanding success in the last 50 years to keep Summer Computer Simulation Conference (SCSC) an important event through many seasons of simulation, some of which were more remarkable than others. This chapter summarizes the panel discussion/contributions of the SCSC 2018 about the seasons in computer simulation and the ways to achieve and further prolong summers of computer simulation.",

      "Title": "Stress-testing remote model querying APIs for relational and graph-based stores",
      "Abstract": "Recent research in scalable model-driven engineering now allows very large models to be stored and queried. Due to their size, rather than transferring such models over the network in their entirety, it is typically more efficient to access them remotely using networked services (e.g. model repositories, model indexes). Little attention has been paid so far to the nature of these services, and whether they remain responsive with an increasing number of concurrent clients. This paper extends a previous empirical study on the impact of certain key decisions on the scalability of concurrent model queries on two domains, using an Eclipse Connected Data Objects model repository, four configurations of the Hawk model index and a Neo4j-based configuration of the NeoEMF model store. The study evaluates the impact of the network protocol, the API design, the caching layer, the query language and the type of database and analyses the reasons for their varying levels of performance. The design of the API was shown to make a bigger difference compared to the network protocol (HTTP/TCP) used. Where available, the query-specific indexed and derived attributes in Hawk outperformed the comprehensive generic caching in CDO. Finally, the results illustrate the still ongoing evolution of graph databases: two tools using different versions of the same backend had very different performance, with one slower than CDO and the other faster than it.",

We also extract the reported application studies and classify these by exploration domains or industry segments that are taking advantage of this technique. The applied research method was systematic mapping, which began with 3713 articles. After applying the exclusion criteria, 1278 articles were selected for review. In this article, an overview regarding process mining is presented, the main research topics are identified, followed by identification of the most applied process mining algorithms, and finally application domains among different business segments are reported on. It is possible to observe that the most active research topics are associated with the process discovery algorithms, followed by conformance checking, and architecture and tools improvements. In application domains, the segments with major case studies are healthcare followed by information and communication technology, manufacturing, education, finance, and logistics.",

      "Abstract": "Robots that support humans by performing useful tasks (a.k.a., service robots) are booming worldwide. In contrast to industrial robots, the development of service robots comes with severe software engineering challenges, since they require high levels of robustness and autonomy to operate in highly heterogeneous environments. As a domain with critical safety implications, service robotics faces a need for sound software development practices. In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study to assess the state of the art and practice of robotics software engineering. We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with industrial practitioners working in 15 companies from 9 different countries and a survey with 156 respondents from 26 countries from the robotics domain. Our results provide a comprehensive picture of (i) the practices applied by robotics industrial and academic practitioners, including processes, paradigms, languages, tools, frameworks, and reuse practices, (ii) the distinguishing characteristics of robotics software engineering, and (iii) recurrent challenges usually faced, together with adopted solutions. The paper concludes by discussing observations, derived hypotheses, and proposed actions for researchers and practitioners.",

      "Title": "Testing embedded software: A survey of the literature",
      "Abstract": "Context: Embedded systems have overwhelming penetration around the world. Innovations are increasingly triggered by software embedded in automotive, transportation, medical-equipment, communication, energy, and many other types of systems. To test embedded software in an effective and efficient manner, a large number of test techniques, approaches, tools and frameworks have been proposed by both practitioners and researchers in the last several decades. Objective: However, reviewing and getting an overview of the entire state-of-the-art and the –practice in this area is challenging for a practitioner or a (new) researcher. Also unfortunately, as a result, we often see that many companies reinvent the wheel (by designing a test approach new to them, but existing in the domain) due to not having an adequate overview of what already exists in this area. Method: To address the above need, we conducted and report in this paper a systematic literature review (SLR) in the form of a systematic literature mapping (SLM) in this area. After compiling an initial pool of 588 papers, a systematic voting about inclusion/exclusion of the papers was conducted among the authors, and our final pool included 312 technical papers. Results: Among the various aspects that we aim at covering, our review covers the types of testing topics studied, types of testing activity, types of test artifacts generated (e.g., test inputs or test code), and the types of industries in which studies have focused on, e.g., automotive and home appliances. Furthermore, we assess the benefits of this review by asking several active test engineers in the Turkish embedded software industry to review its findings and provide feedbacks as to how this review has benefitted them. Conclusion: The results of this review paper have already benefitted several of our industry partners in choosing the right test techniques / approaches for their embedded software testing challenges. We believe that it will also be useful for the large world-wide community of software engineers and testers in the embedded software industry, by serving as an “index” to the vast body of knowledge in this important area. Our results will also benefit researchers in observing the latest trends in this area and for identifying the topics which need further investigations.",

      "Title": "Co-simulation: A survey",
      "Abstract": "Modeling and simulation techniques are today extensively used both in industry and science. Parts of larger systems are, however, typically modeled and simulated by different techniques, tools, and algorithms. In addition, experts from different disciplines use various modeling and simulation techniques. Both these facts make it difficult to study coupled heterogeneous systems. Co-simulation is an emerging enabling technique, where global simulation of a coupled system can be achieved by composing the simulations of its parts. Due to its potential and interdisciplinary nature, cosimulation is being studied in different disciplines but with limited sharing of findings. In this survey, we study and survey the state-of-the-art techniques for co-simulation, with the goal of enhancing future research and highlighting the main challenges. To study this broad topic, we start by focusing on discrete-event-based co-simulation, followed by continuous-time-based co-simulation. Finally, we explore the interactions between these two paradigms, in hybrid co-simulation. To survey the current techniques, tools, and research challenges, we systematically classify recently published research literature on co-simulation, and summarize it into a taxonomy. As a result, we identify the need for finding generic approaches for modular, stable, and accurate coupling of simulation units, as well as expressing the adaptations required to ensure that the coupling is correct.

      "Title": "Model-driven software engineering for construction engineering: Quo vadis?",
      "Abstract": "Models are an inherent part of the construction industry, which leverages from the steady advancements in information and communication technology. One of these advancements is Building Information Modeling (BIM), which denotes the move from 2D drawings to having semantically rich models of the objects subject to construction. Additionally, the way stakeholders collaborate in construction projects and their organization is revisited. This is commonly denoted as Integrated Project Delivery (IPD). Both BIM and IPD originate from the basic principles of Lean Construction, the vision to minimize waste, increase value, and continuous improvement. The application of Model-driven Software Engineering (MDSE) to BIM is a natural choice. Although several approaches utilizing MDSE for BIM have been proposed, so far no structured overview of the current state of the art has been conducted. Such an overview is vitally needed, because the existing literature is fragmented among multiple research areas. Consequently, in this paper, we present a systematic literature review on the application of MDSE to BIM, IPD and Lean Construction resulting in a systematically derived taxonomy, which we used to classify 97 papers published between 2008 and 2018. Based on the taxonomy, we provide an analysis of the classified research showing (a) where the discourse on model-driven construction engineering currently is, (b) the state of the art of model-driven techniques in construction engineering and (c) open research challenges.",

      "Abstract": "Mobile technology and the Internet of Things promise to deepen the interaction between people, services, and physical devices. Digital solutions for these prospective computing systems are not only radically changing the user experience but also the software engineering process. Without a doubt, software complexity enormously increases, and prospective systems become challenging to develop, maintain, and verify. The user's reliance on safety-critical software systems is a serious element in any software engineering process where the absence of bugs must be ensured, and malfunction ruled out. Software that is not safe, i.e., the software's behavior does not comply with a specification, could cause loss of profits or, in the worst-case, harm people. Software safety is an ongoing but mostly academic research field incorporating formal methods to prove the correctness of a program using mathematical methods. In this spirit, we examine the promising context-aware computing and model-driven development paradigms that have directed the development of fog computing and IoT platforms alike. Furthermore, we aggregate viable requirements for computational context models to be employed both for computation and also reasoning about the correctness of applications.",

This makes its development more difficult. The successful design of a CIS is then mainly based on the definition of the requirements engineering phase. In software engineering domain, especially in requirements engineering domain, Viewpoint and abstraction level are two important concepts introduced to reduce systems complexity. In this paper, we present an approach oriented viewpoints/abstraction levels which defines the necessary concepts to elicit the requirements of a CIS. In doing so, a model driven method is proposed to develop a CIS modelling tool. In this method, we proposed first a meta-model oriented viewpoints/abstraction levels which decomposes a CIS according to its different viewpoints. We then proposed a modelling tool, viewpoints for cooperative information system (VpCIS) generated from the meta-model.",

      "Abstract": "End-user programming may utilize Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs) to develop applications in the form of models, using only abstractions found in a specific problem domain. Indeed, the productivity benefits reported from Model-Driven Development (MDD) are hard to ignore, and a number of MDD solutions are flourishing. However, not all stories from industry on MDD are successful. End-users, without having software development skills, are more likely to introduce software errors than professional programmers. In this study, we propose and encourage other DSML developers to extend the development of DSML with tool support. We believe the programming tools (e.g., debugger, testing tool, refactoring tool) are also needed for end-users to ensure the proper functioning of the products they develop. It is imperative that domain experts are provided with tools that work on the abstraction level that is familiar to them. In this paper, an industrial experience is presented for building various tools for usage in MDD. Debugger, automated testing infrastructure, refactoring, and other tools were implemented for Sequencer, a DSML. Our experience with the implementation of tool support for MDD confirms that these tools are indispensable for end-user programming in practice, and that implementing those tools might not be as costly as expected.",

      "Abstract": "Rapid development of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) products and applications, encouraged by advances on the Internet of Things, generates high market demand on engineers with a multi-disciplinary background in mathematics, mechanics, computer science and electrical engineering. One of the challenges in the development of study programs and motivation of students is bridging the gap between industry needs and educational output, in terms of training the prospective researchers and engineers in the CPS field. Riga Technical University (RTU), in cooperation with the other members of Multi-Paradigm Modelling for Cyber-Physical Systems MPM4CPS Cost Action, applied their knowledge and methods to validate in practice the viability of the approach and the methods developed in the COST Action in order to support the introduction of industry-focused curricula at Higher Education Institutions in Partner' countries. In this research, we discuss experience of RTU in motivation of the students in the subject of the electrical engineering. We also discuss how cooperation between COST and ERASMUS project teams provides benefits to both projects, how the COST team efforts towards analysis of tendencies, industry needs and acquiring best education practice, have been applied by ERASMUS+ team in order to create industry-focused curricula in CPS for HEIs of Partner Countries.",

      "Abstract": "More and more tasks become solvable using deep learning technology nowadays. Consequently, the amount of neural network code in software rises continuously. To make the new paradigm more accessible, frameworks, languages, and tools keep emerging. Although, the maturity of these tools is steadily increasing, we still lack appropriate domain specific languages and a high degree of automation when it comes to deep learning for productive systems. In this paper we present a multi-paradigm language family allowing the AI engineer to model and train deep neural networks as well as to integrate them into software architectures containing classical code. Using input and output layers as strictly typed interfaces enables a seamless embedding of neural networks into component-based models. The lifecycle of deep learning components can then be governed by a compiler accordingly, e.g. detecting when (re-)training is necessary or when network weights can be shared between different network instances. We provide a compelling case study, where we train an autonomous vehicle for the TORCS simulator. Furthermore, we discuss how the methodology automates the AI development process if neural networks are changed or added to the system.",

      "Title": "Mortadelo: Automatic generation of NoSQL stores from platform-independent data models",
      "Abstract": "In the last decade, several NoSQL systems have emerged as a response to the scalability problems manifested by classical relational databases when used in Big Data contexts. These NoSQL systems appeared first as physical-level solutions, initially lacking any design methodologies. After this initial batch of systems, several design methodologies for NoSQL have been recently created. Nevertheless, most of these methodologies target just one NoSQL paradigm. In addition, as each methodology uses a different conceptual modeling approach, NoSQL database designers would need to remake conceptual models as they switch from one NoSQL paradigm to another. Moreover, most of these design processes provide just a set of design heuristics and guidelines that database designers need to apply manually, which can be a time-consuming and error-prone process. To overcome these limitations, this article presents Mortadelo, a model-driven NoSQL database design process where, from a high-level conceptual model, independent of any specific NoSQL paradigm, an implementation for a concrete NoSQL database system can be automatically generated. Moreover, this database generation process can be customized, so that some design trade-offs can be managed differently according to each context needs. We evaluated Mortadelo's capabilities by generating database implementations for several typical NoSQL case studies. In these cases, Mortadelo was able to generate implementations for the Cassandra and MongoDB NoSQL systems from the same conceptual data model. These implementations were similar to the ones generated by design methodologies specifically developed for a single paradigm. Therefore, design quality is not sacrificed by our approach in favor of generality.",

A simulation of the global behavior from the heterogeneous executable models is used to verify and validate the emerging behavior of the system. Co-simulation is a way to realize this simulation but it requires coordinating the different heterogeneous artifacts. This coordination is not a trivial task due to the increasing complexity and heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a language that enables the specification of a coordination between models and the automatic generation of a dedicated coordinator (Master Algorithm) concerning the coordination and the behavioral semantics of the executable models.",

      "Abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) have emerged as a potential enabling technology to handle the challenges in social and economic sustainable development. Since it was proposed in 2006, intensive research has been conducted, showing that the construction of a CPS is a hard and complex engineering process due to the nature of integrating a large number of heterogeneous subsystems. Among other approaches to dealing with the complex design issues, model-driven design of CPSs has shown its advantages. In this review paper, we present a survey of research on model-driven development of CPSs. We are concerned mainly with the widely used methods, techniques, and tools, and discuss how these are applied to CPSs. We also present comparative analyses on the surveyed techniques and tools from various perspectives, including their modeling languages, functionalities, and the challenges which they address in CPS design. With our understanding of the surveyed methods, we believe that model-driven approaches are an inevitable choice in building CPSs and further research effort is needed in the development of model-driven theories, techniques, and tools. We also argue that a unified modeling platform is needed. Such a platform would benefit research in the academic community and practical development in industry, and improve the collaboration between these two communities.",

      "Abstract": "The use of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) is a promising field for the development of tools tailored to specific problem spaces, effectively diminishing the complexity of hand-made software. With the goal of making models as precise, simple and reusable as possible, we augment DSLs with concepts from multilevel modelling, where the number of abstraction levels are not limited. This is particularly useful for DSL definitions with behaviour, whose concepts inherently belong to different levels of abstraction. Here, models can represent the state of the modelled system and evolve using model transformations. These transformations can benefit from a multilevel setting, becoming a precise and reusable definition of the semantics for behavioural modelling languages. We present in this paper the concept of Multilevel Coupled Model Transformations, together with examples, formal definitions and tools to assess their conceptual soundness and practical value.",

      "Title": "A multi-paradigm approach for modelling service interactions in model-driven engineering processes",
      "Abstract": "To tackle the growing complexity of engineered systems, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) proposes to promote models to first-class citizens in the development process. Within MDE, Multi-Paradigm Modelling (MPM) advocates modelling every relevant aspect of a system explicitly, using the most appropriate formalism(s), at the most appropriate level(s) of abstraction, while explicitly modelling the underlying process. Often, activities of the process require interaction with (domain-specific) engineering and modelling tools. These interactions are, however, typically captured in scripts and program code, which is ill-suited for describing the timed, reactive, and concurrent behaviour of these protocols. Additionally, formal analysis of the overall process is limited due to the incorporation of black-box activities. In this paper, we propose an approach for the explicit modelling of service interaction protocols in the activities of MDE processes. We also explicitly model the execution semantics of our process model, to promote reuse and allow for future analysability. For both purposes, we propose to use SCCD, a Statecharts variant, resulting in a unified and concise formalism.",

      "Title": "Applications of model-driven engineering in cyber-physical systems: A systematic mapping study",
      "Abstract": "Engineers face significant challenges in developing cyber-physical systems (CPS) due to their heterogeneous nature, i.e. the need for knowledge and skills from a wide range of academic and industrial disciplines, the integration of the artifacts of these disciplines and fields, and the difficulty of maintaining such heterogeneous artifacts should be taken into account. The development of CPS mostly needs a unified methodology that permits efficient raise of the abstraction level to overcome issues of heterogeneity induced by the multidisciplinary nature of the system. Model-driven engineering (MDE) is believed to be an alternative solution to overcome the challenges faced while developing CPS. This paper presents a systematic mapping study on using the MDE paradigm in CPS development and management. 140 research papers published during the period 2010–2018 are evaluated. The study mainly enables to find out the followed approaches when applying MDE for CPS, addressed CPS challenges, application domains and presented case studies. Results showed that the number of publications in this field is continuously increasing in recent years. Results also showed that metamodeling and model-based approaches are mostly adopted by the researchers affiliated to Europe, while DSL-based approach is adopted mostly by USA affiliated researchers. Only 45% of the studies consider a specific CPS application domain in which Smart Manufacturing is the most addressed domain followed by Critical Infrastructure, Health Care and Medicine. Moreover, the majority of the studies present case studies as the main evaluation method for the proposed MDE solutions. Conducting empirical evaluations is mostly missing. The results also revealed that various CPS challenges are addressed, and the most addressed ones are the complexity and interoperability aspects of CPS. Reporting on what previous researches have accomplished, as well as current research efforts and open challenges related to this field can guide researchers and developers in their further work on CPS design and implementation.",

      "Abstract": "The design of gas turbines is a challenging area of cyber-physical systems where complex model-based simulations across multiple disciplines (e.g., performance, aerothermal) drive the design process. As a result, a continuously increasing amount of data is derived during system design. Finding new insights in such data by exploiting various machine learning (ML) techniques is a promising industrial trend since better predictions based on real data result in substantial product quality improvements and cost reduction. This paper presents a method that generates data from multi-paradigm simulation tools, develops and trains ML models for prediction, and deploys such prediction models into an active control system operating at runtime with limited computational power. We explore the replacement of existing traditional prediction modules with ML counterparts with different architectures. We validate the effectiveness of various ML models in the context of three (real) gas turbine bearings using over 150,000 data points for training, validation, and testing. We introduce code generation techniques for automated deployment of neural network models to industrial off-the-shelf programmable logic controllers.",

      "Abstract": "Building distributed computing systems involves complex concerns integrating a multitude of communication styles, technologies (IoT, cloud and big data...), stakeholders (architects, developers, integrators, etc.) and addressing a multitude of application domains (smart cities, health, mobility, etc.). Existing architectural description languages fail to rigorously bridge the gap between the abstract representation of communication styles and those supported by existing execution infrastructures. In this paper, we aim at specifying software architecture of distributed systems using an approach combining semi-formal and formal languages to build reusable model libraries to represent communication solutions. Our contribution is two fold. First, we propose a metamodel to describe high level concepts of architecture in a component- port- connector fashion focusing on communication styles. Second, we attempt to formalize those concepts and their semantics following some properties (specifications) to check architectural conformance. To validate our work, we provide a set of reusable connector libraries within a set of properties to define architectures for systems with explicit communications models like message passing and remote procedure calls, that are common to most distributed systems.",

      "Abstract": "Model-driven engineering can be used to create problem-specific, conceptual models abstracting away unwanted details. Models at runtime take this principle to the time a system is running. Connecting and synchronizing multiple models creates several problems. Usually, models used at runtime must communicate with other systems over the network, they are often based on different paradigms, and in most settings a fast and reactive behaviour is required. We aim for a structured way to define and organize such connections in order to minimize development cost, network usage and computation effort while maximizing interoperability. In order to achieve those goals, we present an extension of the paradigm of models based on reference attribute grammars by creating a dedicated problem-specific language for those connections. We show how to connect several runtime models to a robotic system in order to control this robot and to provide guarantees for safe coexistence with nearby humans. We show, that using our approach, connections can be specified more concisely while maintaining the same efficiency as hand-written code.",

      "Title": "New Trends in Residential Automation",
      "Abstract": "Home automation is a promising market application and a very interesting area of research in the field of automation, where human–machine integration is a key issue. The history of home automation, however, can be traced through various phases since its inception: first, with concepts and equipment inherited from industry automation, then to a phase in which new tools were developed but problems were encountered with design, and finally to a new era where the challenge is to further explore a multidisciplinary approach that conceives of home automation as a service, with a different model for the interaction between the home and its users. In this new phase, the design challenges are quite different, as is the motivation for implementing new architectures for building and residential automation (B&RA). In this article we present a direct comparison between the last two phases of home automation, as described above, and propose a new methodology for designing B&RA systems based on an anthropocentric automation approach. A design discipline for improving integration is applied to models developed at the beginning of this century, achieving good results. This same model is then compared with a new approach, revealing new challenges that could arise in both integration and service. To better understand all of the differences, the older approach is presented along with a case study implemented in Portugal. It introduces new concepts and challenges for B&RAs in implementing sustainable houses and buildings that are also capable of generating energy—as in the urban smart grid. Another important challenge is improving integration with users in terms of service systems.",

      "Abstract": "Industrial automation systems (IAS) need to be highly dependable; they should not merely function as expected but also do so in a reliable, safe, and secure manner. Formal methods are mathematical techniques that can greatly aid in developing dependable systems and can be used across all phases of the system development life cycle (SDLC), including requirements engineering, system design and implementation, verification and validation (testing), maintenance, and even documentation. This state-of-the-art survey reports existing formal approaches for creating more dependable IAS, focusing on static formal methods that are used before a system is completely implemented. We categorize surveyed works based on the phases of the SDLC, allowing us to identify research gaps and promising future directions for each phase.",

      "Title": "Operationalizing the integration of user interaction specifications in the synthesis of modeling editors",
      "Abstract": "A long shortcoming in the automatic generation of domain-specific modeling (DSM) editors has been the lack of user experience, in particular, user interaction adapted to its user. The current practice relies solely on the abstract and concrete syntax of the language, restricting the user interaction with the editor to a set of generic interactions built-in the tool. To increase the user experience with DSM editors, we propose to specify the different viewpoints of interactions (e.g., I/O devices, component of the interface, behavior of the editor) each modeled at the right level of abstraction for its user expert. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, by anchoring the operational semantics of all these viewpoints in a Statecharts model that controls the DSM editor. We report on the complex transformation that takes as input different viewpoints are expressed in at distinct levels of abstraction, to produce a custom interaction with the DSM editor based on a RETE algorithm. Our implementation shows that we can produce correct and responsive results by emulating existing DSM editors.",

      "Title": "Metaization concepts for monitoring-related information",
      "Abstract": "In recent years, structural health monitoring (SHM) has become a widely used state-of-the-art method for analyzing and assessing the condition of civil infrastructure. SHM systems are characterized by a plethora of heterogeneous system components. For optimizing, documenting, and change tracking of SHM systems, information about SHM systems needs to be formally described on a sound basis. However, with current methods, such as ontologies, description languages or metamodels, only a small subset of information inherent to SHM systems, such as information about sensors, can formally be described. This paper presents a conceptual approach towards identifying and specifying monitoring-related information. Based on a summary review of SHM modeling approaches, metaization concepts to overcome the current limitations are discussed and a robust formalism to describe SHM systems mathematically is proposed. The review methodology is based on a three-pillar concept. First, regulations, standards, and guidelines related to SHM and, second, the current research landscape is examined to identify information required for describing SHM systems, and hierarchies of terms are proposed to categorize the findings. Third, metamodel architectures, such as SHM-related ontologies, BIM-based metamodels and description languages, are reviewed with respect to formally describe SHM systems. Being part of the third pillar, mathematical metamodeling approaches based on category theory, set theory and type theory are presented, capable to describe SHM system as well as approaches suitable to couple metamodels. As an outcome of this study, besides a comprehensive review of the above directions, a strategy towards developing a metaization concept is proposed to provide a robust formalism for SHM system descriptions, aiming to advance optimization, documentation, and change tracking of SHM systems.",

      "Title": "Reusable specification templates for defining dynamic semantics of DSLs",
      "Abstract": "In the context of model-driven engineering, the dynamic (execution) semantics of domain-specific languages (DSLs) is usually not specified explicitly and stays (hard)coded in model transformations and code generation. This poses challenges such as learning, debugging, understanding, maintaining, and updating a DSL. Facing the lack of supporting tools for specifying the dynamic semantics of DSLs (or programming languages in general), we propose to specify the architecture and the detailed design of the software that implements the DSL, rather than requirements for the behavior expected from DSL programs. To compose such a specification, we use specification templates that capture software design solutions typical for the (application) domain of the DSL. As a result, on the one hand, our approach allows for an explicit and clear definition of the dynamic semantics of a DSL, supports separation of concerns and reuse of typical design solutions. On the other hand, we do not introduce (yet another) specification formalism, but we base our approach on an existing formalism and apply its extensive tool support for verification and validation to the dynamic semantics of a DSL.",

      "Abstract": "Objective: The goal of this study is to present an overview of industrial and academic approaches to cross-domain model management. We aim at identifying industrial and academic tools for cross-domain model management and describing the inconsistency types addressed by them as well as strategies the users of the tools employ to keep consistency between models of different domains. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review. Using the keyword-based search on Google Scholar we analyzed 515 potentially relevant studies; after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria 88 papers were selected for further analysis. Results: The main findings/contributions are: (i) a list of available tools used to support model management; (ii) approximately 31% of the tools can provide consistency model checking on models of different domains and approximately 24% on the same domain; (iii) available strategies to keep the consistency between models of different domains are not mature enough; (iv) explicit modeling dependencies between models is not common in the industry. However, it is considered as a requirement by academia if one wishes to manage inconsistency between models of different domains. Conclusion: This study presents an overview of industrial practices and academic approaches about the cross-domain model management. The results presented in this study can be used as a starting point for future research on model management topics, and also for further improvement of actual model management tools.",

Results The main findings/contributions are: (i) a list of available tools used to support model management; (ii) 40% of the tools can provide consistency checking on models of different domains and 25% on models of the same domain, and 35% do not provide any consistency checking; (iii) available strategies to keep the consistency between models of different domains are not mature enough; (iv) most of the tools that provide consistency checking on models of different domains can only capture up to two inconsistency types; (v) the main challenges associated with tools that manage models on different domains are related to interoperability between tools and the consistency maintenance. Conclusion The results presented in this study can be used to guide new research on maintaining the consistency between models of different domains.

      "Title": "Spectrum-based fault localization in model transformations",
      "Abstract": "Model transformations play a cornerstone role in Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), as they provide the essential mechanisms for manipulating and transforming models. The correctness of software built using MDE techniques greatly relies on the correctness of model transformations. However, it is challenging and error prone to debug them, and the situation gets more critical as the size and complexity of model transformations grow, where manual debugging is no longer possible. Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) uses the results of test cases and their corresponding code coverage information to estimate the likelihood of each program component (e.g., statements) of being faulty. In this article we present an approach to apply SBFL for locating the faulty rules in model transformations. We evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of the approach by comparing the effectiveness of 18 different state-of-the-art SBFL techniques at locating faults in model transformations. Evaluation results revealed that the best techniques, namely Kulcynski2, Mountford, Ochiai, and Zoltar, lead the debugger to inspect a maximum of three rules to locate the bug in around 74% of the cases. Furthermore, we compare our approach with a static approach for fault localization in model transformations, observing a clear superiority of the proposed SBFL-based method.",

We present herein a concise summary of the workflows we have developed over time to simulate human-movements and dynamics of human-building interactions. We discuss the applications of human behaviour simulation in the analysis of building environments. We then discuss the approaches which use dynamic human-aware simulations in improving environment designs. We highlight the challenges in existing simulation workflows, which are usually decoupled from environment modeling tools or often tightly coupled with any specialized modeling platform. Such workflows require significant infrastructure and domain expertise, hindering the users’ abilities to seamlessly simulate, analyze, and incorporate dynamics of human-building interactions into their preferred design workflows. We introduce a democratized approach using an on-demand service-based workflow for human behaviour simulation and analysis of human-building interactions.",

      "Abstract": "UML profiles offer an intuitive way for developers to build domain-specific modelling languages by reusing and extending UML concepts. Eclipse Papyrus is a powerful open-source UML modelling tool which supports UML profiling. However, with power comes complexity, implementing non-trivial UML profiles and their supporting editors in Papyrus typically requires the developers to handcraft and maintain a number of interconnected models through a loosely guided, labour-intensive and error-prone process. We demonstrate how metamodel annotations and model transformation techniques can help manage the complexity of Papyrus in the creation of UML profiles and their supporting editors. We present Jorvik, an open-source tool that implements the proposed approach. We illustrate its functionality with examples, and we evaluate our approach by comparing it against manual UML profile specification and editor implementation using a non-trivial enterprise modelling language (Archimate) as a case study. We also perform a user study in which developers are asked to produce identical editors using both Papyrus and Jorvik demonstrating the substantial productivity and maintainability benefits that Jorvik delivers.",

      "Title": "Thirteen years of SysML: a systematic mapping study",
      "Abstract": "The OMG standard Systems Modeling Language (SysML) has been on the market for about thirteen years. This standard is an extended subset of UML providing a graphical modeling language for designing complex systems by considering software as well as hardware parts. Over the period of thirteen years, many publications have covered various aspects of SysML in different research fields. The aim of this paper is to conduct a systematic mapping study about SysML to identify the different categories of papers, (i) to get an overview of existing research topics and groups, (ii) to identify whether there are any publication trends, and (iii) to uncover possible missing links. We followed the guidelines for conducting a systematic mapping study by Petersen et al. (Inf Softw Technol 64:1–18, 2015) to analyze SysML publications from 2005 to 2017. Our analysis revealed the following main findings: (i) there is a growing scientific interest in SysML in the last years particularly in the research field of Software Engineering, (ii) SysML is mostly used in the design or validation phase, rather than in the implementation phase, (iii) the most commonly used diagram types are the SysML-specific requirement diagram, parametric diagram, and block diagram, together with the activity diagram and state machine diagram known from UML, (iv) SysML is a specific UML profile mostly used in systems engineering; however, the language has to be customized to accommodate domain-specific aspects, (v) related to collaborations for SysML research over the world, there are more individual research groups than large international networks. This study provides a solid basis for classifying existing approaches for SysML. Researchers can use our results (i) for identifying open research issues, (ii) for a better understanding of the state of the art, and (iii) as a reference for finding specific approaches about SysML.",

      "Title": "Modeling languages in Industry 4.0: an extended systematic mapping study",
      "Abstract": "Industry 4.0 integrates cyber-physical systems with the Internet of Things to optimize the complete value-added chain. Successfully applying Industry 4.0 requires the cooperation of various stakeholders from different domains. Domain-specific modeling languages promise to facilitate their involvement through leveraging (domain-specific) models to primary development artifacts. We aim to assess the use of modeling in Industry 4.0 through the lens of modeling languages in a broad sense. Based on an extensive literature review, we updated our systematic mapping study on modeling languages and modeling techniques used in Industry 4.0 (Wortmann et al., Conference on model-driven engineering languages and systems (MODELS’17), IEEE, pp 281–291, 2017) to include publications until February 2018. Overall, the updated study considers 3344 candidate publications that were systematically investigated until 408 relevant publications were identified. Based on these, we developed an updated map of the research landscape on modeling languages and techniques for Industry 4.0. Research on modeling languages in Industry 4.0 focuses on contributing methods to solve the challenges of digital representation and integration. To this end, languages from systems engineering and knowledge representation are applied most often but rarely combined. There also is a gap between the communities researching and applying modeling languages for Industry 4.0 that originates from different perspectives on modeling and related standards. From the vantage point of modeling, Industry 4.0 is the combination of systems engineering, with cyber-physical systems, and knowledge engineering. Research currently is splintered along topics and communities and accelerating progress demands for multi-disciplinary, integrated research efforts.",

      "Abstract": "One of the targets of European COST Action Multi-Paradigm Modelling for Cyber-Physical Systems (MPM4CPS) was crystallising contents of the Action into a suitable format for educational purposes. This encouraged to create the base for a European Master and PhD program in MPM4CPS involving European Leading Universities and setting up the respective discipline road-map facing the challenge to develop a mutually recognised cross-domain expertise-based study program in CPS. One of the challenges in the development of study programs is bridging the gap between industry needs and educational output, in terms of training the prospective researchers and engineers in the CPS field. The success of MPM4CPS encouraged EU partners to apply knowledge and methods, developed by the COST Action at an ERASMUS+ project, to validate in practice its viability aiming to develop the industry-focused curricula at partners' universities of Belarus and Ukraine. In this research we discuss how the COST team efforts towards analysis of tendencies, industry needs and acquiring best education practice have been made by the ERASMUS+ team in order to create industry-focused cross-domain study programs in CPS for the partners' universities of Belarus and Ukraine.",

In this paper, we survey the advancement of CPSS through cyber-physical systems (CPS), cyber-social ​systems (CSS) and CPSS, as well as related techniques. CPSS are still at their infancy, most recent studies are application-specific and lack of systematic design methodology. To exploit the design methodology for CPSS, we review the existing system-level design methodologies in multiple application domains and further compare their performance characteristics and applicability for CPSS. Finally, we introduce our latest research advancement on system-level design methodology for CPSS and summarize future challenges for designing CPSS.",

      "Abstract": "A recent approach to tackle the ever increasing complexity of simulation system is model-driven engineering (MDE). However, it is mostly used to produce simulation tools, and seldom can perform formal analysis. Consequently, this raises issues like poor qualities of product, and falls short of non-functional requirements such as extensibility, maintainability, and reuse. In general, many of the success of MDE projects depend on the descriptive power of modeling languages and how conceptual models are implemented. Hence, this paper presents contributions in two main aspects: customizing domain specific language by metamodeling and enhancing model continuity by formalizing model transformations. A military application is used as a motivating example to illustrate the whole process by transforming the conceptual models into other more precise formalisms until they reach final executable models.",

      "Abstract": "Model transformations are essential elements of model-driven engineering (MDE) solutions, as they enable the automatic manipulation of models. MDE promotes the creation of domain-specific metamodels, but without proper reuse mechanisms, model transformations need to be developed from scratch for each new metamodel. In this paper, our goal is to understand whether transformation reuse across metamodels is needed by the community, evaluate its current state, identify practical needs and propose promising lines for further research. For this purpose, we first report on a survey to understand the reuse approaches used currently in practice and the needs of the community. Then, we propose a classification of reuse techniques based on a feature model and compare a sample of specific approaches—model types, concepts, a-posteriori typing, multilevel modeling, typing requirement models, facet-oriented modeling, mapping operators, constraint-based model types, and design patterns for model transformations—based on this feature model and a common example. We discuss strengths and weaknesses of each approach, provide a reading grid used to compare their features, compare with community needs, identify gaps in current transformation reuse approaches in relation to these needs and propose future research directions.",

      "Abstract": "Scalability in modeling has many facets, including the ability to build larger models and domain-specific languages (DSLs) efficiently. With the aim of tackling some of the most prominent scalability challenges in model-based engineering (MBE), the MONDO EU project developed the theoretical foundations and open-source implementation of a platform for scalable modeling and model management. The platform includes facilities for building large graphical DSLs, for splitting large models into sets of smaller interrelated fragments, to index large collections of models to speed-up their querying, and to enable the collaborative construction and refinement of complex models, among other features. This paper reports on the tools provided by MONDO that Ikerlan, a medium-sized technology center which in the last decade has embraced the MBE paradigm, adopted in order to improve their processes. This experience produced as a result a set of model editors and related technologies that fostered collaboration and scalability in the development of wind turbine control applications. In order to evaluate the benefits obtained, an on-site evaluation of the tools was performed. This evaluation shows that scalable MBE technologies give new growth opportunities to small- and medium-sized organizations.",

      "Abstract": "Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are natural evolutions of embedded systems consisting of embedded computing devices and networks interacting with physical processes and possibly with a human. By introduction of Internet of Things (IoT), and Industry 4.0, CPSs are used in an interconnected way each of which may belong to a different stakeholder, building a complex System of Systems (SoS) called CPSoS. These systems need to employ some techniques to transform the collected data to knowledge with which the system can make better decisions. These capabilities can create smart CPSoS or sCPSoS. However, these systems are highly complex from both structural and behavioural point of views. Naturally, there is a need for multiple abstraction levels using different paradigms to model these system, called Multi-Paradigm modeling (MPM). In this paper, the challenges and opportunities of using agent technologies, including intelligent agents, Agent-based modeling and Simulation (ABM), and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) (or Agent-oriented Software Engineering (AOSE)) in an integrated way with Model-based System Engineering (MBSE) techniques are discussed to cover the whole lifecycle of sCPSoS, from simulation and analysis, to development, operation and monitoring.",

      "Abstract": "Interaction modeling is a relevant activity during software development processes. Created relying on Petri Nets theory and aiming to represent discrete time events, Colored Petri Nets (CPNs) are a graphical formal language developed and widely employed for system modeling. While traditional CPNs only have elements with ordinary stylization and behaviors, in this article we explore the key ideas behind Web Interaction Modeling Using Colored Petri Nets (wiCPN), a modeling style developed with focus on representing Web interactions as an incremental improvement of CPNs. We review wiCPN’s refinements over CPNs and the modeling of the Web interface of Classroom eXperience (CX), a ubiquitous educational platform, thus verifying the model’s properties to ensure it was able to represent the different access levels among its users and how wiCPN displayed suitability to comprehend this requirement on the generated model. We have also improved the originally developed model with the modification of elements to make it finite and fully analyzable. Also, we added temporization capabilities to the model and ran corresponding user simulation to observe the average time that users with different roles tend to spend during interactions. We compared wiCPN results with Unified Modeling Language (UML) Activity and Use Case diagrams, observing, as outcomes, that the generated model represented CX’s interactive flow correctly and maintained a concise notation—a single wiCPN diagram was sufficient to depict the same interactive flow that, in UML, would require several diagrams, something that could overload the design team in actual software development scenarios. We also included new user experiments comprising qualitative results from experts. Finally, we created a reachability graph for the new model and generated a full state space report, analyzing Petri Nets properties such as boundedness, liveness and home marking.",

      "Abstract": "The variety of smart devices and their communication models increase the development complexity of embedded software for IoT. Thus, the development of these systems becomes more error-prone, complex, and costly. To tackle this problem, in this study, a model-driven approach is proposed for the development of RIOT-OS based IoT systems. To this end, a meta-model is designed for RIOT-OS. Based on this meta-model, a Domain-specific Modeling Language (DSML) is developed to graphically represent the domain models. To gain more functionality for the language, domain rules are defined as constraints. Also, system codes are generated partially from the instance models. In this way, the development is supported by code synthesis and the number of bugs is reduced. Finally, a smart irrigation system and a smart lighting system are implemented to evaluate the proposed DSML. The results show that about 83.5% of the final code is generated automatically on average.",

      "Abstract": "Software systems are rapidly growing in complexity and scale, and are subject to different kinds of uncertainties related to the dynamics of resource availability or changes in system objectives. So, many real usage scenarios might be impossible to reproduce and validate at design-time. As envisioned by the Models@run.time research community, the use of models at runtime is fundamental to address this challenge. Our focus is on providing guarantees for changing safety goals at runtime (a form of uncertainty) with the employment of mathematically-based runtime analysis techniques from the area of formal methods (FM@run.time). In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the runtime simulation of Abstract State Machine models and the on-the-fly changes of safety assertions at the model level to provide software assurance guarantees at runtime. The framework is called AsmetaS@run.time and is being developed as part of the ASM specification and analysis toolset ASMETA.",

We have proposed a model transformation approach based on abstract interpretation, a static program analysis technique. Abstract interpretation allows us to define transformations that are provably correct and specific. This work develops the foundations of this approach to model transformation. We define model transformation in terms of abstract interpretation and prove the soundness of our approach. Furthermore, we develop formalisms useful for encoding model properties. This work provides a methodology for relating models of different aspects of a system and for applying modeling techniques from one system domain, such as smart power grids, to other domains, such as water distribution networks.",

      "Abstract": "Rail road switch heaters are used to avoid the formation of snow and ice on top of rail road switches during the cold season, in order to guarantee their correct functioning. Effective management of the energy consumption of these devices is important to reduce the costs and minimise the environmental impact. While doing so, it is critical to guarantee the reliability of the system. In this work we analyse reliability and energy consumption indicators for a system of (remotely controlled) rail road switch heaters by developing and solving a stochastic model-based approach based on the Stochastic Activity Networks (SAN) formalism. An on-off policy is considered for heating the switches, with parametric thresholds of activation/deactivation of the heaters and considering different classes of priority. A case study has been developed inspired by a real rail road station, to practically demonstrate the application of the proposed approach to understand the impact of different thresholds and priorities on the indicators under analysis (probability of failure and energy consumption).",

      "Title": "DEVS for AUTOSAR-based system deployment modeling and simulation",
      "Abstract": "AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) is an open and standardized automotive software architecture, developed by automobile manufacturers, suppliers, and tool developers. Its design is a direct consequence of the increasingly important role played by software in vehicles. As design choices during the software deployment phase have a large impact on the behavior of the system, designers need to explore various trade-offs. Examples of such design choices are the mapping of software components to processors, the priorities of tasks and messages, and buffer allocation. In this paper, we evaluate the appropriateness of DEVS, the Discrete-Event System specification, for modeling and subsequent performance evaluation of AUTOSAR-based systems. Moreover, a DEVS simulation model is constructed for AUTOSAR-based electronic control units connected by a communication bus. To aid developers in evaluating a deployment solution, the simulation model is extended with co-simulation with a plant and environment model, evaluation at different levels of detail, and fault injection. Finally, we examine how the simulation model supports the relationship between the supplier and the original equipment manufacturer in the automotive industry. We demonstrate and validate our work by means of a power window case study.",

      "Abstract": "This paper presents how to integrate formally based models relying on the Synchronous Dataflow Model-of-Computation (MoC) in a UML/MARTE component-based application model. This model corresponds to a flexible and expressive modelling methodology, which facilitates finding and building an application model with the intended semantics, but does not help to ensure a strict fulfilment of functional and extrafunctional requirements. However, this capability has become a need in the context of modelling mixed-criticality applications. This paper shows how the component-based UML/MARTE models captured in such a flexible methodology can integrate parts transformable into synchronous data-flows. This formalism facilitates the analysis of the functional and extra-functional properties of such parts. Specifically, the paper shows a set of modelling patterns which can be translated into SDF counterparts. Relying on these patterns, a framework has been implemented which enables a bi-directional interoperability between the UML/MARTE models abiding the patterns and the formally-based ForSyDe methodology.",

      "Title": "A practical ontology framework for static model analysis",
      "Abstract": "In embedded software, there are many reasons to include concepts from the problem domain during design. Not only does doing so make the software more comprehensible to those with domain understanding, it also becomes possible to check that the software conforms to correctness criteria expressed in the domain of interest. Here we present a unified framework that enables users to create ontologies representing arbitrary domains of interest and analyses over those domains. These analyses may then be run against software specifications, encapsulated as models, checking that they are sound with respect to the given ontology. Our approach is general, in that the framework is agnostic to the semantic meaning of the ontologies that it uses and does not privilege the example ontologies that we present here. Where practical use-cases and principled theory exist, we provide for the expression of certain patterns of infinite ontologies. In this paper we present two patterns of infinite ontologies: those containing values, and those containing ontologies recursively. We show how these two patterns map to use cases of unit systems and structured data types, and show how these are applicable to cyber-physical systems examples drawn from automotive and avionic domains. Despite the range of ontologies and analyses that we present here, we see user-built ontologies as a key feature of our approach.",

      "Title": "A Behavioral Coordination Operator Language (BCOoL)",
      "Abstract": "The design of complex systems involves various, possibly heterogeneous, structural and behavioral models. In model-driven engineering, the coordination of behavioral models to produce a single integrated model is necessary to provide support for validation and verification. Indeed, it allows system designers to understand and validate the global and emerging behavior of the system. However, the manual coordination of models is tedious and error-prone, and current approaches to automate the coordination are bound to a fixed set of coordination patterns. In this paper, we propose a Behavioral Coordination Operator Language (B-COoL) to reify coordination patterns between specific domains by using coordination operators between the Domain-Specific Modeling Languages used in these domains. Those operators are then used to automate the coordination of models conforming to these languages. We illustrate the use of B-COoL with the definition of coordination operators between timed finite state machines and activity diagrams.",

      "Abstract": "Cyber physical systems (CPSs) can be found nowadays in various fields of activity. The increased interest for these systems as evidenced by the large number of applications led to complex research regarding the most suitable methods for design and development. A promising solution for specification, visualization, and documentation of CPSs uses the Object Management Group (OMG) unified modeling language (UML). UML models allow an intuitive approach for embedded systems design, helping end-users to specify the requirements. However, the UML models are represented in an informal language. Therefore, it is difficult to verify the correctness and completeness of a system design. The object constraint language (OCL) was defined to add constraints to UML, but it is deficient in strict notations of mathematics and logic that permits rigorous analysis and reasoning about the specifications. In this paper, we investigated how CPS applications modeled using UML deployment diagrams could be formally expressed and verified. We used Z language constructs and prototype verification system (PVS) as formal verification tools. Considering some relevant case studies presented in the literature, we investigated the opportunity of using this approach for validation of static properties in CPS UML models. © 2013 Journal of Zhejiang University Science Editorial Office and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

      "Title": "Preliminary interdependency analysis: An approach to support critical-infrastructure risk-assessment",
      "Abstract": "We present a methodology, Preliminary Interdependency Analysis (PIA), for analysing interdependencies between critical infrastructure (CI). Consisting of two phases – qualitative analysis followed by quantitative analysis – an application of PIA progresses from a relatively quick elicitation of CI-interdependencies to the building of representative CI models, and the subsequent estimation of any resilience, risk or criticality measures an assessor might be interested in. By design, stages in the methodology are both flexible and iterative, resulting in interacting CI models that are scalable and may vary significantly in complexity and fidelity, depending on the needs and requirements of an assessor. For model parameterisation, one relies on a combination of field data, sensitivity analysis and expert judgement. Facilitated by dedicated software tool support, we illustrate PIA by applying it to a complex case-study of interacting Power (distribution and transmission) and Telecommunications networks in the Rome area. A number of studies are carried out, including: 1) an investigation of how “strength of dependence” between the CIs’ components affects various measures of risk and uncertainty, 2) for resource allocation, an exploration of different, but related, notions of CI component importance, and 3) highlighting the impact of model fidelity on the estimated risk of cascades.",

In this domain, there is the need of tools supporting the design and analysis of applications. In this paper, the Smart Environment Metamodel (SEM) framework is proposed. The framework allows to model applications by exploiting concepts specific to the smart environment domain. SEM approaches the modeling from two different points of view, namely the functional and data perspectives. The application of the framework is supported by a set of general guidelines to drive the analysis, the design and the implementation of smart environments. The effectiveness of the framework is shown by applying it to the modeling of a real smart office scenario that has been developed, deployed and analyzed.",

The proposed method is highly inspired in integrated product design methods typically used by mechanical engineers.

      "Abstract": "The adoption of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) is regarded as an approach to reduce the accidental complexity of software systems development. The availability of sophisticated language workbenches facilitates the development of DSLs making them increasingly more popular. The adoption of DSLs at large comes at the risk that a poorly designed DSL can be too hard to adopt by its domain users. As such, Usability is one of the essential characteristics to mitigate this risk as it has an important impact on the productivity achieved by DSL users. The current state of practice in Software Language Engineering (SLE) neglects the Usability of DSLs. A pertinent research question in SLE is how to engineer Usability into DSLs systematically. We argue that a timely systematic approach based on User Interface experimental evaluation techniques should be used to assess the impact of DSLs during their development process, while the cost of fixing the usability problems is relatively small, when compared to fixing them at the end of the development process. For that purpose, we introduce a conceptual framework, called USE-ME, which supports the iterative incremental development process of DSLs concerning the issue of their Usability evaluation. We illustrate the feasibility of the approach on a case study of the development of a DSL meant for children to program robots.",

      "Abstract": "Evolutionary computing has demonstrated its effectiveness in supporting the development of robust and intelligent systems: when used in combination with formal and quantitative models, it becomes a primary tool in critical systems. Among the modern critical infrastructures, smart energy grids are getting a growing interest from many communities (academic, industrial and political) fostering the development of a robust energy distribution infrastructure. Energy grids are also an example of critical cyber physical social systems since their equilibrium can be perturbed not only by cyber and physical attacks but also by economical and social crises as well as changes in the consumption profiles. The paper illustrates a practical framework supporting the run-time evolution of the control logic inside the Smart Meter: the centre of modern Smart Homes. By combining the modeling and analysis capabilities of Fluid Stochastic Petri Nets and the flexibility of Genetic Programming, this approach can be used to adapt the control logic of the Smart Meters to the changes of the structure and functionalities of the Smart Home as well as of the operational environment. While the main objective of the evolution is to guarantee the energetic sustainability of the Smart Home, the fulfilment of the user's requirements about the energetic need of the home allows to preserve the identity of the Smart Meter during its evolution.",

      "Abstract": "Process simulations are useful test-beds for experiments and optimizations along the entire industrial plant life-cycle. Shifting testing and tuning of industrial plants and their automation systems from the real world to simulated environments is a part of a virtualization, which is one of the key movements in emerging areas of Industry 4.0 and factories of the future. Although simulations bring a large variety of benefits, they suffer from a time-consuming and error-prone design phase, which limits their use in industrial practice. This paper proposes a new design method called AML2SIM, which transforms the real plant description represented in AutomationML (AML) and generates a dynamic simulation model (SIM). The proposed method signifcantly improves the engineering and re-design of simulation models in terms of saving time and effort of experts as the models can be easily re-generated based on a given AutomationML plant model. Simulations are assembled from simulation blocks that are shared among various projects in simulation libraries, hence the method contributes to reuse of simulation artifacts.",

In this context, the ongoing deregulation of network operation gives relevance to modeling and evaluation techniques supporting predictability of dependability metrics. We propose a modeling approach that represents maintenance procedures as a multi-phased system, with parameters depending on physical and geographical characteristics of the network, working hours, and evolution of loads over the day. The overall model is cast into a non-Markovian variant of stochastic Petri nets, which allows concurrent execution of multiple generally distributed transitions but maintains a complexity independent of network size and topology. Solution is achieved through an interleaved execution of fluid-dynamic analysis of the network and analytic solution of the stochastic model of the procedure. Solution provides availability measures for individual sections of the network as well as global quality of service parameters. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",

Software will build communities of autonomous agents at runtime which exploit local and global networking to enhance and optimize their functionality leading to self-adaptation or self-optimization.

Our approach, MechatronicUML, addresses the outlined challenge by proposing a coherent and integrated model-driven development approach which supports the modeling and verification of safety guarantees for systems with reconfiguration of software components at runtime.

This chapter examines the impact of heterogeneity on the composition and compositionality properties of models and tools and argues that new horizontal integration platforms for models, tools, and executions need to be developed to achieve progress. Using actual experience with developing an integrated design automation tool suite for vehicle power trains, OpenMETA, the chapter discusses the integration architecture and presents examples for a key component of the model and tool integration platforms, the OpenMETA Semantic Backplane.",

      "Abstract": "The development of mechatronic products involves multiple stakeholders which have different viewpoints and therefore use different concepts, models and tools to deal with their concerns of interest. This paper argues that an increased emphasis needs to be placed on the relations between viewpoints to be able to deal with the evolving scope and requirements on mechatronic products. We study relations between viewpoints at the levels of people, models and tools, and present solutions that are used to formally and explicitly capture such relations. Viewpoint contracts are used to define the vocabulary, assumptions and constraints required for ensuring smooth communication between stakeholders (people level). Dependency models capture relations between product properties belonging to different viewpoints, and how such dependencies relate to predictions and decisions (model level). Tool integration models describe the relations between tools in terms of traceability, data exchange, invocation and notifications (tool level). A major contribution of this paper is a unification approach, elaborating how these solutions can be used synergetically to integrate viewpoints. An industrial robot case study is utilized to illustrate the challenges and solutions with respect to relations between viewpoints, including the unification approach.",

      "Title": "Convergence of physical system and cyber system modeling methods for aviation cyber physical control system",
      "Abstract": "Recent attention to aviation cyber physical systems (ACPS) is driven by the need for seamless integration of design disciplines that dominate physical world and cyber world convergence. System convergence is a big obstacle to good aviation cyber-physical system (ACPS) design, which is due to a lack of an adequate scientific theoretical foundation for the subject. The absence of a good understanding of the science of aviation system convergence is not due to neglect, but rather due to its difficulty. Most complex aviation system builders have abandoned any science or engineering discipline for system convergence they simply treat it as a management problem. Aviation System convergence is almost totally absent from software engineering and engineering curricula. Hence, system convergence is particularly challenging in ACPS where fundamentally different physical and computational design concerns intersect. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach to handle System convergence of aviation cyber physical systems based on multi-dimensions, multi-views, multi-paradigm and multiple tools. This model-integrated development approach addresses the development needs of cyber physical systems through the pervasive use of models, and physical world, cyber world can be specified and modeled together, cyber world and physical world can be converged entirely, and cyber world models and physical world model can be integrated seamlessly. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by means of one practical case study: specifying and modeling Aircraft Systems. In this paper, We specify and model Aviation Cyber-Physical Systems with integrating Modelica, Modelicaml and Architecture Analysis & Design Language (AADL), the physical world is modeled by Modelica and Modelicaml, the cyber part is modeled by AADL and Modelicaml.",

      "Abstract": "Multi-Paradigm Modelling (MPM) has been proposed to tackle the complexities found in Cyber-Physical Systems. MPM advocates the explicit modelling of all pertinent parts and aspects of complex systems. It adresses and integrates three orthogonal dimensions: multi-abstraction modelling, concerned with the (refinement, generalization,...) relationships between models; multi-formalism modelling, concerned with the (multi-view, multi-component,...) coupling of and transformation between models described in different formalisms; explicitly modelling the often complex, concurrent workflows. Current modelling, analysis and simulation tools support only isolated parts of MPM. The core methods and techniques enabling MPM are modelling language engineering, model operations (such as transformation and simulation), and workflow modelling. This paper delves into each enabler, presenting its relation to MPM and how it is supported in our prototype tool: the Modelverse. An automotive power window example is used to illustrate the Modelverse's capabilities. All aspects are explicitly modelled and enacted with a Formalism Transformation Graph + Process Model (FTG+PM).",

This requires us to go beyond current variability modeling and management techniques which neglect the complexity and the diversity of relevant stakeholders, data and assets, and thus cannot cope with intelligent business and analytics requirements in dynamic environments, such as smart city management. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis for understanding the multi-perspective variability in processes atop people, data and things in CPSs, particularly, for the sustainability governance of Smart Green Buildings (SGBs). We examine domain-specific processes and domain-specific elements and their relationships to derive a multiple-perspective variability management for SGBs. On the basis of this, we conceptualize a novel model for the multi-perspective process variability representation.",

Given the many challenges and open issues involved, a number of initiatives have been ongoing in the last decade, researching methods and developing tools for resilience assessment of critical infrastructures. Moving from the major challenges posed by CI from the point of view of resilience assessment and assessment needs, this chapter overviews a modelling framework for the analysis of interdependencies in Electric Power Systems (EPS), adopting a state-based stochastic approach. First, it is shown how the selected approach deals with the interdependencies, complexity, heterogeneity and scalability dictated by the infrastructures involved in framework implementation are then discussed, and some illustrative examples of different typologies of analysis are provided on selected EPS scenarios.",

These experts normally have their own domain-specific designing methods and tools, which can lead to incompatibilities when one needs to work together using these those methods and tools. Having a proper framework which integrates different design tools is of interest, as such a framework can prevent incompatibilities between parts during the design process. In this paper, we propose our co-modelling methodology and co-simulation tools integration framework, which helps to maintain the domain specific properties of the model components during the co-design process of various mechatronic devices. To avoid expensive rework later in the design phase and even possible system failure, fault modelling and a layered structure with fault-tolerance mechanisms for the controller software are introduced. In the end, a practical mechatronic device is discussed to illustrate the methods and tools which are presented in this paper in details. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The use of complex platforms means that the engineers need to make non-trivial and many times non-intuitive decisions during the design phase. This situation creates a need for better ways to manage project complexity, and Model Driven Engineering is a possible solution. In this work, we propose an extension of a Model Driven Engineering methodology (i.e. HIPAO2) to help manage complexity, which includes an automated Design Space Exploration phase that uses Genetic Algorithms to find the best application-to-platform mapping. We discuss about HIPAO2's characteristics as an MD-DSE methodology, applying it to readily available benchmarks, and to randomly-generated application models.",

New challenges are arising due to highly heterogeneous and distributed systems which interact with and have an impact on the physical world, so called cyber-physical systems. Since millions of test kilometers must be driven to ensure a reliable system, simulation-based verification is becoming more important to reduce costs and time-to-market. This situation prompts the urgent demand for new techniques to simulate the behavior in early development phases by reusing verified system components. Best combined within a model-based approach that both unites different stakeholders and helps non-specialists to understand problems in the design.

      "Abstract": "The introduction of security flaws into a system may result from design or implementation mistakes. It entail far-reaching consequences for connected embedded or cyber-physical systems, including physical harm. Security experts focus either on finding out and deriving security mechanisms from more or less explicitly defined security requirements or on the a posteriori assessment of vulnerabilities, namely pentesting. These approaches however often miss the necessary iterations between security countermeasures and system functionalities in terms of design and deployment. Worse, they generally fail to consider the implications of security issues over the system’s safety, like for instance the adverse effect that security countermeasures may produce over expected deadlines due to costly computations and communications latencies. SysML-Sec focuses on these issues throughout design and development thanks to its model-driven approach that promotes exchanges between system architects, safety engineers, and security experts. This paper discusses how SysML-Sec can be used to simultaneously deal with safety and security requirements, and illustrates the methodology with an automotive use case.",

Modeling pragmatics also entails constructing different views of a system, but here the focus is on syntactic/pragmatic aspects, with an emphasis on designer productivity, and the views are constructed automatically by filtering and drawing algorithms. In this paper, we argue that both approaches will have growing influence on model-based design, in particular for complex cyber-physical systems, and we identify a number of general developments that seem likely to contribute to this until 2020. This includes notably the trend towards domain-specific modeling and agile development, novel input devices, and the move to the cloud. We also report on preliminary practical results in this area with two modeling environments, Ptolemy and kieler, and the lessons learned from their combined usage.",

      "Title": "``System-of-systems'' approach for interdependent critical infrastructures",
      "Abstract": "The study of the interdependencies within critical infrastructures (CI) is a growing field of research as the importance of potential failure propagation among infrastructures may lead to cascades affecting all supply networks. New powerful methods are required to model and describe such systems-of-systems (SoS) as a whole. An overall model is required to provide security and reliability assessment taking into account various kinds of threats and failures. A significant challenge associated with this model may be to create what-if scenarios for the analysis of interdependencies. In this paper the interdependencies between industrial control systems (ICS), in particular SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition), and the underlying critical infrastructures to address the vulnerabilities related to the coupling of these systems are analyzed. The modeling alternatives for system-of-systems, integrated versus coupled models, are discussed. An integrated model contains detailed low level models of (sub)systems as well as a high level model, covering all hierarchical levels. On the other hand, a coupled model aggregates different simulated outputs of the low level models as inputs at a higher level. Strengths and weaknesses of both approaches are analyzed and a model architecture for SCADA and the system under control are proposed. Furthermore, the HLA simulation standard is introduced and discussed in this paper as a promising approach to represent interdependencies between infrastructures. To demonstrate the capabilities of the HLA standard for the interdependencies study, an exemplary application and some first results are also briefly presented in this paper. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.",

      "Title": "A knowledge-based tool for designing cyber physical production systems",
      "Abstract": "Changing production systems and product requirements can trace their origin in volatile customer behaviour and evolving product requirements. This dynamic nature of customer requirements has been described as a constantly moving target, thus presenting a significant challenge for several aspects of product development. To deal with this constant and sometimes unpredictable product evolution, cyber physical production systems (CPPS) that employ condition monitoring, self-awareness and reconfigurability principles, have to be designed and implemented. This research contributes a CPPS design approach that proactively provides the required CPPS design knowledge. This approach aims to minimise or avoids future consequences and disruptions on the CPPS. This knowledge needs to be provided at the right time whilst not being intrusive to the production system designer's cognitive activity. To effectively deal with the complexity of the cyber physical production system design activity with a manual method would lead to a time consuming, and complex support tool which is hard to implement, and difficult to use. The CPPS design approach has therefore been implemented in a prototype digital factory tool. This paper describes in detail the system requirements and system architecture for this tool. In order to establish the effectiveness of the proposed approach for designing cyber physical production systems, the prototype digital factory tool has been evaluated with a case study and a number of semi-structured interviews with both industrial and scientific stakeholders. The encouraging results obtained from this research evaluation have shown that such an approach for supporting the CPPS design activity makes stakeholders aware of their decision consequences and is useful in practice. This result can lead the way for the development and integration of such knowledge-based decision-making approaches within state-of-the-art digital factory and Computer Aided Engineering Design (CAED) tools.",

      "Title": "Automatic generation of test system instances for configurable cyber-physical systems",
      "Abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are ubiquitous systems that integrate digital technologies with physical processes. These systems are becoming configurable to respond to the different needs that users demand. As a consequence, their variability is increasing, and they can be configured in many system variants. To ensure a systematic test execution of CPSs, a test system must be elaborated encapsulating several sources such as test cases or test oracles. Manually building a test system for each configuration is a non-systematic, time-consuming, and error-prone process. To overcome these problems, we designed a test system for testing CPSs and we analyzed the variability that it needed to test different configurations. Based on this analysis, we propose a methodology supported by a tool named ASTERYSCO that automatically generates simulation-based test system instances to test individual configurations of CPSs. To evaluate the proposed methodology, we selected different configurations of a configurable Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, and measured the time required to generate their test systems. On average, around 119 s were needed by our tool to generate the test system for 38 configurations. In addition, we compared the process of generating test system instances between the method we propose and a manual approach. Based on this comparison, we believe that the proposed tool allows a systematic method of generating test system instances. We believe that our approach permits an important step toward the full automation of testing in the field of configurable CPSs.",

      "Title": "Integration of facility modeling capabilities for nuclear nonproliferation analysis",
      "Abstract": "Developing automated methods for data collection and analysis that can facilitate nuclear nonproliferation assessment is an important research area with significant consequences for the effective global deployment of nuclear energy. Facility modeling that can integrate and interpret observations collected from monitored facilities in order to ascertain their functional details will be a critical element of these methods. Although improvements are continually sought, existing facility modeling tools can characterize all aspects of reactor operations and the majority of nuclear fuel cycle processing steps, and include algorithms for data processing and interpretation. Assessing nonproliferation status is challenging because observations can come from many sources, including local and remote sensors that monitor facility operations, as well as open sources that provide specific business information about the monitored facilities, and can be of many different types. Although many current facility models are capable of analyzing large amounts of information, they have not been integrated in an analyst-friendly manner. This paper addresses some of these facility modeling capabilities and illustrates how they could be integrated and utilized for nonproliferation analysis. The inverse problem of inferring facility conditions based on collected observations is described, along with a proposed architecture and computer framework for utilizing facility modeling tools. After considering a representative sampling of key facility modeling capabilities, the proposed integration framework is illustrated with several examples. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

      "Title": "A multi-paradigm modeling foundation for collaborative multi-view model/system development",
      "Abstract": "Recent research in scalable model-driven engineering now allows very large models to be stored and queried. Due to their size, rather than transferring such models over the network in their entirety, it is typically more efficient to access them remotely using networked services (e.g. model repositories, model indexes). Little attention has been paid so far to the nature of these services, and whether they remain responsive with an increasing number of concurrent clients. This paper extends a previous empirical study on the impact of certain key decisions on the scalability of concurrent model queries on two domains, using an Eclipse Connected Data Objects model repository, four configurations of the Hawk model index and a Neo4j-based configuration of the NeoEMF model store. The study evaluates the impact of the network protocol, the API design, the caching layer, the query language and the type of database and analyses the reasons for their varying levels of performance. The design of the API was shown to make a bigger difference compared to the network protocol (HTTP/TCP) used. Where available, the query-specific indexed and derived attributes in Hawk outperformed the comprehensive generic caching in CDO. Finally, the results illustrate the still ongoing evolution of graph databases: two tools using different versions of the same backend had very different performance, with one slower than CDO and the other faster than it.",

      "Title": "Virtual engineering at work: The challenges for designing mechatronic products",
      "Abstract": "The product race has become an innovation race, reconciling challenges of branding, performance, time to market and competitive pricing while complying with ecological, safety and legislation constraints. The answer lies in \"smart\" products of high complexity, relying on heterogeneous technologies and involving active components. To keep pace with this evolution and further accelerate the design cycle, the design engineering process must be rethought. The paper presents a mechatronic simulation approach to achieve this goal. The starting point is the current virtual prototyping paradigm that is widely adopted and that continues to improve in terms of model complexity, accuracy, robustness and automated optimization. Two evolutions are discussed. A first one is the extension to multi-physics simulation answering the design needs of the inherent multi-disciplinarity of \"intelligent\" products. Integration of thermal, hydraulic, mechanical, haptic and electrical functions requires simulation to extend beyond the traditional CAD-FEM approach, supporting the use of system, functional and perception models. The second evolution is the integration of control functions in the products. Where current industrial practice treats mechanical system design and control design as different design loops, this paper discusses their integration in a model-based design process at all design stages, turning concepts such as software-in-the-loop and hardware-in-the-loop into basic elements of an industrial design approach. These concepts are illustrated by a number of automotive design engineering cases, which demonstrate that the combined use of perception, geometric and system models allows to develop innovative solutions for the active safety, low-emission and high-comfort performance of next-generation vehicles. This process in turn poses new challenges to the design in terms of the specification and validation of such innovative products, including their failure modes and fault-tolerant behaviour. This will imply adopting a model-based system engineering approach that is currently already common practice in software engineering. © 2012 The Author(s).",

      "Title": "Model-driven engineering of simulations for smart roads",
      "Abstract": "Smart Roads (SRs) are systems that provide traffic-related services, based on a combination of sensor and actuator networks deployed in roads, vehicles, and surrounding elements. They are complex distributed systems that involve multiple heterogeneous components and technologies. This makes their development a challenging and costly process. Simulations are a key tool to deal with these issues, as they allow developing and testing in fully controlled environments with simplified software components. Nevertheless, they still need to consider multiple perspectives (e.g. experts and designers), which frequently cause problems to understand and validate them. Model-Driven Engineering of simulations appears as a solution. It uses models to represent explicitly these perspectives, and transformations to link them and generate new artifacts (including code). This paper presents a framework to develop simulations of SRs following this approach. Its base is an existing modeling language related to road traffic which is adapted to specify the aspects of these systems (i.e. sensors, networks, and services), and their context (i.e. users, vehicles, and their environment). A process guides its use in the transition from abstract models to code supported by tailored tools. A case study on a system to track vehicles using sensors in roads illustrates its use.",

      "Title": "View oriented approach to specify and model aerospace cyber-physical systems",
      "Abstract": "The analysis and design of aerospace cyber physical systems call for the proper dimensioning of mechanical, electronic and embedded control subsystems from different views. Usually, the physical world part and the cyber part are modeled independently of each others. This modeling approach does not exploit many potential advantages of an integrated specification, analysis and design process, which are lost in the separate points of view of different engineering domains. In fact, the physical properties and the dynamical behavior of physical world parts play a central role in aerospace cyber physical systems development process. Thus, significant improvements to overall system performances can be obtained by early integrating the physical world and the cyber part development. It is clear that an appropriate specification and modeling approach cannot be fitted into the limitations of one formalism at time, particularly in the early stages of the design process. Hence, it is necessary to take a combination of different methodologies in a multi-formalism approach from different views. In this paper, we propose a view oriented approach to integrated different models, at different level of details to specify and model aerospace cyber physical systems as a whole. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by means of one practical case study: specifying and modeling the lunar rover system. In this paper, we specify and model the lunar rover with integrating Modelica and AADL, the physical world is modeled by Modelica, the cyber part is modeled by AADL. © 2013 IEEE.",

In this domain, there is the need of tools supporting the design and analysis of applications. In this paper, the Smart Environment Metamodel (SEM) framework is proposed. The framework allows to model applications by exploiting concepts specific to the smart environment domain. SEM approaches the modeling from two different points of view, namely the functional and data perspectives. The application of the framework is supported by a set of general guidelines to drive the analysis, the design and the implementation of smart environments.

      "Abstract": "Recent advances in technology enable the creation of complex industrial systems comprising mechanical, electrical, and logical - software - components. It is clear that new project techniques are demanded to support the design of such systems. At design phase, it is extremely important to raise abstraction level in earlier stages of product development in order to deal with such a complexity in an efficient way. This paper discusses Model Driven Engineering (MDE) applied to design industrial mechatronics systems. An aspect-oriented MDE approach is presented by means of a real-world case study, comprising requirements engineering up to code generation. An assessment of two well-known high-level paradigms, namely Aspect- and Object-Oriented paradigms, is deeply presented. Their concepts are applied at every design step of an embedded and real-time mechatronics system, specifically for controlling a product assembler industrial cell. The handling of functional and non-functional requirements (at modeling level) using aspects and objects is further emphasized. Both designs are compared using a set of software engineering metrics, which were adapted to be applied at modeling level. Particularly, the achieved results show the suitability of each paradigm for the system specification in terms of reusability quality of model elements. Focused on the generated code for each case study, statistics depicted an improvement in number of lines using aspects.",

      "Title": "Uncertainty-Wise Cyber-Physical System test modeling",
      "Abstract": "It is important that a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) with uncertainty in its behavior caused by its unpredictable operating environment, to ensure its reliable operation. One method to ensure that the CPS will handle such uncertainty during its operation is by testing the CPS with model-based testing (MBT) techniques. However, existing MBT techniques do not explicitly capture uncertainty in test ready models, i.e., capturing the uncertain expected behavior of a CPS in the presence of environment uncertainty. To fill this gap, we present an Uncertainty-Wise test-modeling framework, named as UncerTum, to create test ready models to support MBT of CPSs facing uncertainty. UncerTum relies on the definition of a UML profile [the UML Uncertainty Profile (UUP)] and a set of UML Model Libraries extending the UML profile for Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded Systems (MARTE). UncerTum also benefits from the UML Testing Profile V.2 to support standard-based MBT. UncerTum was evaluated with two industrial CPS case studies, one real-world case study, and one open-source CPS case study from the following four perspectives: (1) Completeness and Coverage of the profiles and Model Libraries in terms of concepts defined in their underlying uncertainty conceptual model for CPSs, i.e., U-Model and MARTE, (2) Effort required to model uncertainty with UncerTum, and (3) Correctness of the developed test ready models, which was assessed via model execution. Based on the evaluation, we can conclude that we were successful in modeling all the uncertainties identified in the four case studies, which gives us an indication that UncerTum is sufficiently complete. In terms of modeling effort, we concluded that on average UncerTum requires 18.5% more time to apply stereotypes from UUP on test ready models.",

      "Title": "Transactional execution of hierarchical reconfigurations in cyber-physical systems",
      "Abstract": "Cyber-physical systems reconfigure the structure of their software architecture, e.g., to avoid hazardous situations and to optimize operational conditions like their energy consumption. These reconfigurations have to be safe so that the systems protect their users or environment against harmful conditions or events while changing their structure. As software architectures are typically built on components, reconfiguration actions need to take into account the component structure. This structure should support vertical composition to enable hierarchically encapsulated components. While many reconfiguration approaches for cyber-physical and embedded real-time systems allow the use of hierarchically embedded components, i.e., vertical composition, none of them offers a modeling and verification solution to take hierarchical composition, i.e., encapsulation, into account thus limiting reuse and compositional verification. In this paper, we present an extension to our existing modeling language, MechatronicUML, to enable safe hierarchical reconfigurations. The three extensions are (a) an adapted variant of the 2-phase-commit protocol to initiate reconfigurations that maintain component encapsulation, (b) the integration of feedback controllers during reconfiguration, and (c) a verification approach based on (timed) model checking for instances of our model. We illustrate our approach on a case study in the area of smart railway systems by showing two different use cases of our approach. We show that using our approach the systems can be easily designed to reconfigure safely.",

      "Title": "Foundations for Streaming Model Transformations by Complex Event Processing",
      "Abstract": "Streaming model transformations represent a novel class of transformations to manipulate models whose elements are continuously produced or modified in high volume and with rapid rate of change. Executing streaming transformations requires efficient techniques to recognize activated transformation rules over a live model and a potentially infinite stream of events. In this paper, we propose foundations of streaming model transformations by innovatively integrating incremental model query, complex event processing (CEP) and reactive (event-driven) transformation techniques. Complex event processing allows to identify relevant patterns and sequences of events over an event stream. Our approach enables event streams to include model change events which are automatically and continuously populated by incremental model queries. Furthermore, a reactive rule engine carries out transformations on identified complex event patterns. We provide an integrated domain-specific language with precise semantics for capturing complex event patterns and streaming transformations together with an execution engine, all of which is now part of the Viatra reactive transformation framework. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with two case studies: one in an advanced model engineering workflow; and one in the context of on-the-fly gesture recognition.",

      "Abstract": "Cyber-physical systems have developed into a very active research field, with a broad range of challenges and research directions going from requirements, to implementation and simulation, as well as validation and verification to guarantee essential properties. In this survey paper, we focus exclusively on the following fundamental issue: how to link physicality and computation, continuous time-space dynamics with discrete untimed ones? We consider that cyber-physical system design flow involves the following three main steps: (1) cyber-physical systems modeling; (2) discretization for executability; and (3) simulation and implementation. We review—and strive to provide insight into possible approaches for addressing—the key issues, for each of these three steps.",

      "Title": "Towards a secure service provisioning framework in a Smart city environment",
      "Abstract": "Over the past few years the concept of Smart cities has emerged to transform urban areas into connected and well informed spaces. Services that make smart cities “smart” are curated by using data streams of smart cities i.e., inhabitants’ location information, digital engagement, transportation, environment and local government data. Accumulating and processing of these data streams raise security and privacy concerns at individual and community levels. Sizeable attempts have been made to ensure the security and privacy of inhabitants’ data. However, the security and privacy issues of smart cities are not only confined to inhabitants; service providers and local governments have their own reservations — service provider trust, reliability of the sensed data, and data ownership, to name a few. In this research we identified a comprehensive list of stakeholders and modelled their involvement in smart cities by using the Onion Model approach. Based on the model we present a security and privacy-aware framework for service provisioning in smart cities, namely the ‘Smart Secure Service Provisioning’ (SSServProv) Framework. Unlike previous attempts, our framework provides end-to-end security and privacy features for trustable data acquisition, transmission, processing and legitimate service provisioning. The proposed framework ensures inhabitants’ privacy, and also guarantees integrity of services. It also ensures that public data is never misused by malicious service providers. To demonstrate the efficacy of SSServProv we developed and tested core functionalities of authentication, authorisation and lightweight secure communication protocol for data acquisition and service provisioning. For various smart cities service provisioning scenarios we verified these protocols by an automated security verification tool called Scyther.",

      "Title": "A Modal Specification Approach for On-Demand Medical Systems",
      "Abstract": "Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) places models as first-class artifacts throughout the software lifecycle. In this context, model transformations are crucial for the success of MDE, being comparable in role and importance to compilers for high-level programming languages. Thus, several model transformation approaches have been developed in the last decade, whereby originally most of them are based on the abstract syntax of modeling languages. However, this implementation specific focus makes it difficult for modelers to develop model transformations, because they are familiar with the concrete syntax but not with its computer internal representation. To tackle this problem, model transformation by-example approaches have been proposed which follow the same fundamental idea as query by-example and programming by-example approaches. Instead of using the computer internal representation of models, examples represented in concrete syntax are used to define transformations. Because different transformation scenarios occur in MDE, different by-example approaches have been developed. This chapter gives an overview on the emerging concepts, techniques, and approaches in this young by-example area. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",

Additional design challenges arise when these functions share computing resources and belong to different criticality levels.

      "Abstract": "Urban management is increasingly dependent on the construction of cyber-physical systems, which have been widely deployed in multiple fields, including agriculture, transportation, and health care. Cyberphysical systems provide a large volume of big sensory data. Thus, the application of big data for urban emergency decision-making has become a challenge. Traditional decision-making models are unable to overcome several technical problems, including spatio-temporal information support and access to real-time service for disaster management and emergency response. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal enabled urban decision-making process modeling method in the cyber-physical environment and discuss the development off our basic metadata components, the definition of eleven-tuple information description structure. A prototype system is designed for modeling registering, management, visualization, and other functions. Decision-making processes are implemented as composite process chains through three phases, i.e., decision-making process modeling, instantiation of the decision-making process chain and execution of the decision-making process chain. For application to gas leak events, the decision-making process is executed to confirm the feasibility of the proposed decision-making process modeling method and the flexibility of the eleven-tuple information structure.",

      "Title": "Adaptive numerical algorithms in space weather modeling",
      "Abstract": "Space weather describes the various processes in the Sun-Earth system that present danger to human health and technology. The goal of space weather forecasting is to provide an opportunity to mitigate these negative effects. Physics-based space weather modeling is characterized by disparate temporal and spatial scales as well as by different relevant physics in different domains. A multi-physics system can be modeled by a software framework comprising several components. Each component corresponds to a physics domain, and each component is represented by one or more numerical models. The publicly available Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) can execute and couple together several components distributed over a parallel machine in a flexible and efficient manner. The framework also allows resolving disparate spatial and temporal scales with independent spatial and temporal discretizations in the various models.Several of the computationally most expensive domains of the framework are modeled by the Block-Adaptive Tree Solarwind Roe-type Upwind Scheme (BATS-R-US) code that can solve various forms of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, including Hall, semi-relativistic, multi-species and multi-fluid MHD, anisotropic pressure, radiative transport and heat conduction. Modeling disparate scales within BATS-R-US is achieved by a block-adaptive mesh both in Cartesian and generalized coordinates. Most recently we have created a new core for BATS-R-US: the Block-Adaptive Tree Library (BATL) that provides a general toolkit for creating, load balancing and message passing in a 1, 2 or 3 dimensional block-adaptive grid. We describe the algorithms of BATL and demonstrate its efficiency and scaling properties for various problems.BATS-R-US uses several time-integration schemes to address multiple time-scales: explicit time stepping with fixed or local time steps, partially steady-state evolution, point-implicit, semi-implicit, explicit/implicit, and fully implicit numerical schemes. Depending on the application, we find that different time stepping methods are optimal. Several of the time integration schemes exploit the block-based granularity of the grid structure.The framework and the adaptive algorithms enable physics-based space weather modeling and even short-term forecasting. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

      "Abstract": "Cyber-physical attacks are posing great threats to the safety and security of cyber-physical systems. Modeling cyber-physical attacks reasonably and efficiently is the basis for defending cyber-physical systems effectively, which requires the development of quantitative analysis and modeling approaches for expressing threat propagation in cyber-physical systems. This paper extends the colored Petri net model by defining a probabilistic colored Petri net model that comprises basic models, rules, logical operators and transitions that describe threat propagation between nodes. Basic cyber-physical attack models based on probabilistic colored Petri nets are presented. Furthermore, a systematic modeling approach is presented for constructing a quantitative cyber-physical attack model for a cyber-physical system. The weights of the cyber-physical attack model connections are computed using a mixed-strategy attack-defense game model for each node and solving the Nash equilibrium. Additionally, a hierarchical method of division and integration is proposed to efficiently model complex, large-scale cyber-physical systems. Finally, the systematic cyber-physical attack modeling approach is applied to a case study involving a thermal power plant.",

Due to the critical functions of a protection system, the quantitative evaluation of its effectiveness is an important issue that still raises several challenges. In this paper we propose a model-driven approach to support the design and the evaluation of physical protection systems based on (a) UML models representing threats, protection facilities, assets, and relationships among them, and (b) the automatic construction of a Bayesian Network model to estimate the vulnerability of different system configurations. Hence, the proposed approach is useful both in the context of vulnerability assessment and in designing new security systems as it enables what-if and cost–benefit analyses. A real-world case study is further illustrated in order to validate and demonstrate the potentiality of the approach. Specifically, two attack scenarios are considered against the depot of a mass transit transportation system in Milan, Italy.",

Our idea adopts a formal-methods-based model integration approach, dedicated to architecture-centric virtual integration for embedded software systems, in an early design phase. We thus expect to improve and enhance Correct By Construction in the design. The considered formal methods consist of timing specification, design by contracts, and semantics interoperability for models to be integrated in the system. The application domains of our approach include automotive and avionic systems.",

      "Title": "Model transformations for round-trip engineering in control deployment co-design",
      "Abstract": "When developing a control algorithm for a mechatronic system, its deployment on hardware is rarely taken into account. Hardware properties such as execution performance, memory consumption, communication delays, buffer sizes, (un)reliability of the communication channel, etc. are often not the first concern of the control engineer. However, these properties may have important effects on the control loop behaviour such that initial requirements may no longer be fulfilled. To tackle this issue, we propose a Round-Trip Engineering (RTE) method allowing for a semi-automatic integration of hardware properties, corresponding to the deployment, into the control model. The proposed RTE method combines techniques of model transformations and model-based design space exploration. The resulting method will enable an engineer to further enhance the control model based on implementation properties such that the initial requirements are still satisfied when deployed on the target hardware platform.",

However, the history of the VIATRA model transformation framework dates back to over 16 years. Starting as an early academic research prototype as part of the M.Sc project of the the first author it first evolved into a Prolog-based engine followed by a family of open-source projects which by now matured into a component integrated into various industrial and open-source tools and deployed over multiple technologies. This invited paper briefly overviews the evolution of the VIATRA/IncQuery family by highlighting key features and illustrating main transformation concepts along an open case study influenced by an industrial project.",

How do we validate a hybrid model when the whole (the combined model) is greater than the sum of its parts (the individual models)?

      "Abstract": "Two main embedded software components, application software and platform software, i.e., the real-time operating system (RTOS), interact with each other in order to achieve the functionality of the system. However, they are so different in behaviors that one behavior modeling language is not sufficient to model both styles of behaviors and to reason about the characteristics of their individual behaviors as well as their parallel behavior and interaction properties. In this paper, we present a formal approach to the synthesis of the application software and the RTOS behavior models. In this approach, each of them is modeled with its adequate modeling language and then is composed into a system model for analysis. Moreover, this paper also presents a consistent way of analyzing the application software with respect to both functional requirements and timing requirements. To show the effectiveness of the approach, a case study is conducted, where ARINC 653 and its application are modeled and verified against timing requirements. Using our approach, application software can be constructed as a behavioral model independently from a specific platform and can be verified against various platforms and timing constraints in a formal way.",

Motivated by the rapidly transforming landscape for big data analytics and predictive maintenance decision making, we have created a system capable of providing end users with recommendations to improve asset lifecycles. Methodologically, a cost minimization algorithm is used to analyze a large industry service and warranty data sets and two analytical decision models were developed and applied to a case study for an electrical circuit breaker maintenance problem. Some of these techniques can be applied to other industries, such as jet engine maintenance, and can be expanded to others with implications for robust decision analysis. The SMDSS provides a predictive analytical model that can be applied in manufacturing and service based industries. Our findings and results show that existing solution algorithms and optimization models can be applied to large data sets to lay out executable decisions for managers.",

      "Title": "Design and verification of Cyber-Physical Systems using TrueTime, evolutionary optimization and UPPAAL",
      "Abstract": "Timing imperfections in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) components affect their performance and reliability. This investigation presents a methodology to design and verify CPS using multi-objective evolutionary optimization, model checking and supporting software tools. The time-varying delays in CPS are modeled as constant delays plus jitter. It is shown that the CPS design problem is a trade-off between performance and jitter margin. To make good trade-offs, this investigation models the design problem as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem. The design algorithm results in a non-linear and multi-objective optimization problem that is generally difficult to solve. To overcome this computation barrier, this investigation uses the evolutionary algorithm Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II). Solution of the optimization problem computes the proportional integral and derivative controller gains that simultaneously maximize the jitter margin while improving the system performance. Implementing the CPS controller in embedded platform requires the selection and validation of the process schedules as well as network protocols. To validate the CPS design, the computed controller gains are simulated in TrueTime to verify the performance for a given network protocol and processor scheduling policy. Three scheduling policies are considered due to their appropriateness for use with temporal imperfections: fixed priority, earliest deadline first and deadline monotonic. Finally, to verify the CPS for timing guarantees, a timed-automata model is used that defines the timing interfaces among the components. The formal model is then used to verify CPS response time and properties such as safety using computation tree logic in UPPAAL model checker. The proposed CPS design and verification approach is illustrated on an industrial mine pump example. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach can be used to design and validate CPS for performance and verify timing guarantees. The proposed method provides a systematic design and verification approach that can be used for deployments of CPS in industries.",

      "Abstract": "Securing critical systems such as cyber physical systems (CPS) is an important feature especially when it comes to critical transmitted data. At the same time, the implementation of security counter-measures in such systems may impact other functional or non-functional concerns. In this context, we propose a model-based approach for securing critical systems at early design stage. This approach combines security analysis and mitigation solution proposals with multi-concern architectural evaluation. It exploits two views of security countermeasures patterns: abstract and concrete. The abstract view is used to select relevant solutions to security requirements on a logical point of view. Then, the concrete view helps the architect evaluating different possible implementation alternatives against other design constraints. The modeling is based on accepted OMG standards such as UML and MARTE. In this paper, the approach is illustrated on a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system case study and a tool chain based on Papyrus UML supports the approach.",

      "Title": "A domain-specific language for the control of self-adaptive component-based architecture",
      "Abstract": "Self-adaptive behaviours in the context of Component-based Architecture are generally designed based on past monitoring events, configurations (component assemblies) as well as behavioural programs defining the adaptation logics and invariant properties. Providing assurances on the navigation through the configuration space remains a challenge. That requires taking decisions on predictions on the possible futures of the system in order to avoid going into branches of the behavioural program leading to bad configurations. We propose the design of self-adaptive software components based on logical discrete control approaches, in which the self-adaptive behavioural models enrich component controllers with a knowledge not only on events, configurations and past history, but also with possible future configurations. This article provides the description, implementation and discussion of Ctrl-F, a Domain-specific Language whose objective is to provide high-level support for describing these control policies. Ctrl-Fis formally defined by translation to Finite State Automata models, which allow for the exploration of behavioural programs by verification or Discrete Controller Synthesis, i.e., by automatically generating a controller to enforce correct self-adaptive behaviours. We integrate Ctrl-F with FraSCAti, a Service Component Architecture middleware platform and we illustrate the use of Ctrl-Fby applying it to two case studies.",

      "Abstract": "The consideration of an embedded device's power consumption and its management is increasingly important nowadays. Currently, it is not easily possible to integrate power information already during the platform exploration phase. In this paper, we discuss the design challenges of today's heterogeneous HW/SW systems regarding power and complexity, both for platform vendors as well as system integrators. As a result, we propose a reference framework and design flow concept that combines system-level power optimization techniques with platform-based rapid prototyping. Virtual executable prototypes are generated from MARTE/UML and functional C/C++ descriptions, which then allows to study different platforms, mapping alternatives, and power management strategies. Our proposed flow combines system-level timing and power estimation techniques available in commercial tools with platform-based rapid prototyping. We propose an efficient code annotation technique for timing and power properties enabling fast host execution as well as adaptive collection of power traces. Combined with a flexible design-space exploration (DSE) approach our flow allows a trade-off analysis between different platforms, mapping alternatives, and optimization techniques, based on domain-specific workload scenarios. The proposed framework and design flow has been implemented in the COMPLEX FP7 European integrated project. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

A prototype system is implemented using a commercial multi-paradigm modeling tool. In this prototype, JIT principles are applied to both the production and the material handling processes. The system performance is evaluated and system optimization directions are suggested.

      "Title": "Holistic security requirements analysis for socio-technical systems",
      "Abstract": "Security has been a growing concern for large organizations, especially financial and governmental institutions, as security breaches in the systems they depend on have repeatedly resulted in billions of dollars in losses per year, and this cost is on the rise. A primary reason for these breaches is that the systems in question are “socio-technical” a mix of people, processes, technology, and infrastructure. However, such systems are designed in a piecemeal rather than a holistic fashion, leaving parts of the system vulnerable. To tackle this problem, we propose a three-layer security analysis framework consisting of a social layer (business processes, social actors), a software layer (software applications that support the social layer), and an infrastructure layer (physical and technological infrastructure). In our proposal, global security requirements lead to local security requirements, cutting across conceptual layers, and upper-layer security analysis influences analysis at lower layers. Moreover, we propose a set of analytical methods and a systematic process that together drive security requirements analysis across the three layers. To support analysis, we have defined corresponding inference rules that (semi-)automate the analysis, helping to deal with system complexity. A prototype tool has been implemented to support analysts throughout the analysis process. Moreover, we have performed a case study on a real-world smart grid scenario to validate our approach.",

      "Abstract": "It is widely acknowledged that Automated Demand Response (ADR) is a key factor for the success of the Smart Grid. However, for ADR to be realized to its full extent a new generation of Building Automation Systems (BASs) will have to be developed and the existing upgraded to leverage dynamic tariff plans and curtailment calls sent from the grid. It is well known that developing BASs is an involved matter, mostly because application software is costly to develop and maintain. In practice, this state of affairs is slowing the rise of innovative solutions for ADR. In recent years, software engineering practices such as Model-Driven Engineering have been proposed as a means to alleviate the problem of developing BASs, which we believe should be presented to the Smart Grid community. This article presents the main challenges of creating software for BASs (from a modelling perspective), overviews the state-of-the-art and presents an outlook on possible model-driven engineering techniques that can be effectively applied to significantly improve the development of BASs in the near future. © 2011 IEEE.",

      "Title": "Model-transformation-based computational design synthesis for mission architecture optimization",
      "Abstract": "In this paper, a model-based approach to exploring the trade space of multi-spacecraft mission architectures is introduced. Missions involving multiple spacecraft are inherently more complex to design than traditional single spacecraft missions. This is particularly true for fractionated mission concepts, where spacecraft have diverse roles and distributed responsibilities, and fulfilling mission goals requires communication and collaboration. In practice, this complexity and the lack of computational models and tools limit design teams to consider small design spaces and force them to quickly fixate on a single mission design. However, design fixation at such early stages often leads to sub-optimal designs. Towards overcoming this limitation, we propose an automated approach to exploring and visualizing the trade space of multi-spacecraft mission architectures that aids users in decision making, and provides a basis for identifying solutions that are Pareto-optimal with respect to user-defined science requirements, technical and resource constraints, and mission objectives. Central to our approach is the automated synthesis and analysis of mission architecture alternatives from a set of user-provided functional requirements and mission goals, as well as a library of spacecraft components and analysis models. Design rules (synthesis knowledge) are provided in the form of model-transformation rules. Sequences of endogenous model transformations are applied in-place to produce sets of candidate solutions, thereby effectively searching the design space. The search process is guided by the specified objectives, and is implemented using evolutionary algorithms. We demonstrate our approach to architectural optimization using a simplified radio interferometry mission design as a case study. We conclude that using the proposed approach, the number and diversity of candidate mission architectures available for consideration can be significantly increased. Furthermore, the automated synthesis and evaluation of mission architectures can lead to emergent and non-intuitive solutions to be discovered.",

      "Title": "Reducing auxiliary energy consumption of heavy trucks by onboard prediction and real-time optimization",
      "Abstract": "The electric engine cooling system, where the coolant pump and the radiator fan are driven by electric motors, admits advanced control methods to decrease auxiliary energy consumption. Recent publications show the fuel saving potential of optimal control strategies for the electric cooling system through offline simulations. These strategies often assume full knowledge of the drive cycle and compute the optimal control sequence by expensive global optimization methods. In reality, the full drive cycle is unknown during driving and global optimization not directly applicable on resource-constrained truck electronic control units. This paper reports state-of-the-art engineering achievements of exploiting vehicular onboard prediction for a limited time horizon and minimizing the auxiliary energy consumption of the electric cooling system through real-time optimization. The prediction and optimization are integrated into a model predictive controller (MPC), which is implemented on a dSPACE MicroAutoBox and tested on a truck on a public road. Systematic simulations show that the new method reduces fuel consumption of a 40-tonne truck by 0.36% and a 60-tonne truck by 0.69% in a real drive cycle compared to a base-line controller. The reductions on auxiliary fuel consumption for the 40-tonne and 60-tonne trucks are about 26% and 38%, respectively. Truck experiments validate the consistency between simulations and experiments and confirm the real-time feasibility of the MPC controller.",

      "Title": "Models, metamodels, and model transformation for cyber-physical systems",
      "Abstract": "One approach to increasing the sustainability of critical systems is to fortify them with cyber infrastructure that monitors the system, enables early diagnosis of faults, and provides decision support that facilitates greater efficacy. Modeling and analysis of the resulting cyber-physical systems is a significant challenge, as the physical and cyber infrastructures can be very different in time scales, complexity, and architecture. Model composition is a potential solution. Metamodeling seeks to facilitate model composition by providing methods for composing models of different types, including performance and dependability models, as well as methods for transforming one type of model to another. This paper describes the application of metamodeling to cyber-physical systems. Our proposed approach to model transformation is based on abstract interpretation, a program analysis technique. Models exist for disparate attributes of cyber-physical systems, but these models are typically domain-specific. We seek to map models from one physical domain to another, or to extract a model of one system attribute from a model of another attribute. This ability would considerably increase the utility of the existing body of knowledge on modeling of cyber-physicals systems.",

      "Abstract": "This paper provides a first step in recognizing where we have been and some of the challenges that lie ahead in the design of complex engineered systems. The history of Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) simulation and Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) are reviewed in the context of their respective roles in the development of complex engineered systems. The combination of HIL and MBSE is then proposed as a paradigm shift in the way design is performed, bringing valuable information early to the designer. However, there is much work to be done in understanding how to combine these two concepts and how to handle the information that would be generated. It is on the shoulders of both academia and industry to tackle different elements of this problem, as one entity acting alone will not effectively solve it. If history is a guide, industry will tend to linearly grow capabilities of existing toolsets to support existing customer bases. Academia will explore innovative approaches in the laboratory which may be of little practical use in industry. Research to determine the best way to integrate the total systems viewpoint and system effectiveness aspects of MBSE with the HIL simulation aspects of virtual HIL toolsets will bring those capabilities to bear jointly on complex engineered systems sooner and more effectively.",

      "Title": "High-level frameworks for the specification and verification of scheduling problems",
      "Abstract": "Over the years, schedulability of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) has mainly been performed by analytical methods. These techniques are known to be effective but limited to a few classes of scheduling policies. In a series of recent work, we have shown that schedulability analysis of CPS could be performed with a model-based approach and extensions of verification tools such as UPPAAL. One of our main contributions has been to show that such models are flexible enough to embed various types of scheduling policies, which goes beyond those in the scope of analytical tools. However, the specification of scheduling problems with model-based approaches requires a substantial modeling effort, and a deep understanding of the techniques employed in order to understand their results. In this paper we propose simplicity-driven high-level specification and verification frameworks for various scheduling problems. These frameworks consist of graphical and user-friendly languages for describing scheduling problems. The high-level specifications are then automatically translated to formal models, and results are transformed back into the comprehensible model view. To construct these frameworks we exploit a meta-modeling approach based on the tool generator Cinco. Additionally we propose in this paper two new techniques for scheduling analysis. The first performs runtime monitoring using the CUSUM algorithm to detect alarming change in the system. The second performs optimization using efficient statistical techniques. We illustrate our frameworks and techniques on two case studies.",

      "Title": "Model-driven performance prediction of systems of systems",
      "Abstract": "Systems of systems exhibit characteristics that pose difficulty in modelling and predicting their overall performance capabilities, including the presence of operational independence, emergent behaviour, and evolutionary development. When considering systems of systems within the autonomous defence systems context, these aspects become increasingly critical, as constraints on the performance of the final system are typically driven by hard constraints on space, weight and power. System execution modelling languages and tools permit early prediction of the performance of model-driven systems; however, the focus to date has been on understanding the performance of a model rather than determining whether it meets performance requirements, and only subsequently carrying out analysis to reveal the causes of any requirement violations. Moreover, such an analysis is even more difficult when applied to several systems cooperating to achieve a common goal—a system of systems. In this article, we propose an integrated approach to performance prediction of model-driven real-time embedded defence systems and systems of systems. Our architectural prototyping system supports a scenario-driven experimental platform for evaluating model suitability within a set of deployment and real-time performance constraints. We present an overview of our performance prediction system, demonstrating the integration of modelling, execution and performance analysis, and discuss a case study to illustrate our approach.",

      "Abstract": "Two innovations are enhancing programming languages' capabilities. First, modularity lets you combine independently developed languages without changing their respective definitions. A language is no longer a fixed quantity; you can extend it with domain-specific constructs as needed. Second, projectional editing lets you build editors and IDEs that don't require parsers. Such editors and IDEs support a range of tightly integrated notations, including textual, symbolic, tabular, and graphical notations. In addition, by avoiding parsers, they avoid grammar composition's well-known limitations. Three examples illustrate how these two innovations affect programming-language design. A set of modular extensions of C for embedded programming enables efficient code generation and formal analysis. A language for requirements engineering flexibly combines structured and unstructured (prose) data. Finally, a language for defining insurance rules uses mathematical notation. These examples all rely on the open source JetBrains MPS (Meta Programming System) language workbench. This article is part of a special issue on Software Architecture.",

      "Title": "Analyzing a wind turbine system: From simulation to formal verification",
      "Abstract": "Many industrial systems are hybrid by nature, most often being made of a discrete controller that senses and regulates the execution of a plant characterized by continuous dynamics. Examples of such systems include wind turbines that convert wind energy into electrical energy. Designing industrial control systems is challenging, due to the mixed nature of requirements (functional, timing, etc.) as well as due to the complexity stemming from the interaction of the controller with the plant. Model-based techniques help in tackling the design challenges, whereas methods such as simulation with tools like MATLAB/Simulink can be employed for analysis. Although practical, these methods alone cannot ensure full predictability, due to the fact that they cannot guarantee system properties for all possible executions of the system model. In order to ensure that the system will behave as expected under any operational circumstance, formal verification and validation procedures need to be added to the actual development process. In this paper, we propose an extension of the iFEST (industrial Framework for Embedded Systems Tools) process and platform for embedded systems design with model-based testing using MaTeLo, and model checking time-dependent requirements with the UPPAAL tool, as means of increasing the confidence in the system's behavior. To show the feasibility of the techniques on industrially-sized systems, we analyze a wind turbine industrial prototype model against functional and timing requirements. We capture the execution semantics of the plant and controller components of the wind turbine via logical clocks and constraints expressed in the clock constraint specification language (CCSL) of UML MARTE, after which we construct real-time models amenable to model checking, by mapping the timed behavior (expressed in CCSL) of the real-time components of the wind turbine, onto timed automata. Our work is a first application on an industrial wind turbine system of complementary methods for formal analysis, that is, model-based testing, and model checking a mathematically tractable system abstraction based on data obtained by simulating the system with MATLAB/Simulink. We also discuss relevant modeling and verification challenges encountered during our experiences with the wind turbine system.",

      "Abstract": "The development and analysis of increasingly complex systems require the intensive use of models and of sophisticated approaches to systems modeling. This paper focuses on workflows supporting the solution of complex, composed, formal models used to study and/or develop real-world systems. The workflows we deal with orchestrate multiple distributed tools and applications in order to provide the user with a powerful, composed solution environment. The aim is to automate and reproduce analysis and simulation tasks starting from a high level, graph-based description of the model to be solved. This paper thus introduces solution workflows and presents the Solution Process Definition Language (SPDL) for the specification of solution workflows processes. One of the key elements of SPDL is its formal semantics, which allow for unambiguous specification of its constructs and validation of the workflows. A workflow pattern analysis of SPDL is also provided. SPDL and its execution environment, the OsMoSys framework, are then applied to a homeland security scenario. The OsMoSys framework and the SPDL language provide a practical contribution to the applicability of model engineering techniques by enabling the semiautomatic solution of complex models. © 2006 IEEE.",

By creating network models of infrastructure, resources and processes, it is possible to prioritize risks and identify critical vulnerabilities in processes, organizations and systems. Consequently, network models can be used to create effective plans for improving resilience. The main idea is to use a directed graph to construct a network risk model that can be used to identify the most effective options for improving resilience. Methods and tools for building and analyzing such models will be presented along with an actual case study of a supply chain in Afghanistan.",

      "Title": "Contract-based modeling and verification of timed safety requirements within SysML",
      "Abstract": "In order to cope with the growing complexity of critical real-time embedded systems, systems engineering has adopted a component-based design technique driven by requirements. Yet, such an approach raises several issues since it does not explicitly prescribe how system requirements can be decomposed on components nor how components contribute to the satisfaction of requirements. The envisioned solution is to design, with respect to each requirement and for each involved component, an abstract specification, tractable at each design step, that models how the component is concerned by the satisfaction of the requirement and that can be further refined toward a correct implementation. In this paper, we consider such specifications in the form of contracts. A contract for a component consists in a pair (assumption, guarantee) where the assumption models an abstract behavior of the component’s environment and the guarantee models an abstract behavior of the component given that the environment behaves according to the assumption. Therefore, contracts are a valuable asset for the correct design of systems, but also for mapping and tracing requirements to components, for tracing the evolution of requirements during design and, most importantly, for compositional verification of requirements. The aim of this paper is to introduce contract-based reasoning for the design of critical real-time systems made of reactive components modeled with UML and/or SysML. We propose an extension of UML and SysML languages with a syntax and semantics for contracts and the refinement relations that they must satisfy. The semantics of components and contracts is formalized by a variant of timed input/output automata on top of which we build a formal contract-based theory. We prove that the contract-based theory is sound and can be applied for a relatively large class of SysML system models. Finally, we show on a case study extracted from the automated transfer vehicle (http://www.esa.int/ATV) that our contract-based theory allows to verify requirement satisfaction for previously intractable models.",

      "Title": "FAME: A UML-based framework for modeling fuzzy self-adaptive software",
      "Abstract": "Context: Software Fuzzy Self-Adaptation (SFSA) is a fuzzy control-based software self-adaptation paradigm proposed to deal with the fuzzy uncertainty existing in self-adaptive software. However, as many software engineers lack fuzzy control knowledge, it is difficult for them to design and model this kind of fuzzy self-adaptive software (F-SAS). Therefore, efficient and effective modeling technologies and tools are needed for the SFSA framework. Objective: This paper aims to identify modeling requirements of F-SAS and to provide a modeling framework to specify, design and model F-SAS systems. Such a framework can simplify modeling process of F-SAS and improve the accessibility of software engineers to the SFSA paradigm. Method: This study proposes a modeling framework called Fuzzy self-Adaptation ModEling (FAME). By extending UML, FAME creates three types of modeling views. An analysis view called Fuzzy Case Diagram is created to specify the fuzzy self-adaptation goal and the realization processes of this goal. A structure view called Fuzzy Class Diagram is created to describe the fuzzy concepts and structural characteristics of F-SAS. A behavior view called Fuzzy Sequence Diagram is created to depict the dynamic behaviors of the F-SAS systems. The framework is implemented as a plug-in of Enterprise Architect. Results: We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach by carrying out a subject-based empirical evaluation. The results show that FAME framework can improve modeling quality of F-SAS systems by 44.38% and shorten modeling time of F-SAS systems by 38.41% in comparison with traditional UML. Thus, FAME can considerably ease the modeling process of F-SAS systems. Conclusion: FAME framework incorporates the SFSA concepts into standard UML. Therefore, it provides a direct support to model SFSA characteristics and improves the accessibility of software engineers to the SFSA paradigm. Furthermore, it behaves a good example and provides good references for modeling domain-specific software systems.",

      "Title": "Using model driven engineering to support multi-paradigms security analysis",
      "Abstract": "Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) intrinsically combine hardware and physical systems with software and network, which are together creating complex and correlated interactions. CPS applications often experience uncertainty in interacting with environment through unreliable sensors. They can be faulty and exhibit runtime errors if developers have not considered environmental interaction uncertainty adequately. Existing work in verifying CPS applications ignores interaction uncertainty and thus may overlook uncertainty-related faults. To improve verification accuracy, in this article we propose a novel approach to verifying CPS applications with explicit modeling of uncertainty arisen in the interaction between them and the environment. Our approach builds an Interactive State Machine network for a CPS application and models interaction uncertainty by error ranges and distributions. Then it encodes both the application and uncertainty models to Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) formula to leverage SMT solvers searching for counterexamples that represent application failures. The precision of uncertainty model can affect the verification results. However, it may be difficult to model interaction uncertainty precisely enough at the beginning, because of the uncontrollable noise of sensors and insufficient data sample size. To further improve the accuracy of the verification results, we propose an approach to identifying and calibrating imprecise uncertainty models. We exploit the inconsistency between the counterexamples' estimate and actual occurrence probabilities to identify possible imprecision in uncertainty models, and the calibration of imprecise models is to minimize the inconsistency, which is reduced to a Search-Based Software Engineering problem. We experimentally evaluated our verification and calibration approaches with real-world CPS applications, and the experimental results confirmed their effectiveness and efficiency.",

      "Abstract": "The multifaceted nature of cyber-physical systems needs holistic study methods to detect essential aspects and interrelations among physical and cyber components. Like the systems themselves, security threats feature both cyber and physical elements. Although to apply divide et impera approaches helps handling system complexity, to consider just one aspect at a time does not provide adequate risk awareness and hence does not allow to design the most appropriate countermeasures. To support this claim, in this paper we provide a joint application of two model-driven techniques for physical and cyber-security evaluation. We apply two UML profiles, namely SecAM (for cyber-security) and CIP-VAM (for physical security), in combination. In such a way, we demonstrate the synergy between both profiles and the need for their tighter integration in the context of a reference case study from the railway domain. Graphical abstract",

      "Title": "Towards a search-based interactive configuration of cyber physical system product lines",
      "Abstract": "Product Line Engineering (PLE) is a technique to improve the quality and productivity of developing (via configuration) Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs). A CPS often contains many heterogeneous components with complex constraints relevant to product configuration in the context of PLE. Manual configuration is error-prone and has low productivity since managing and manipulating such constraints in a real industrial context is very complicated and thus warrants an automated solution. However, fully automated solution is often impossible for CPSs since some decisions must be made manually by users, thus requiring an interactive configuration solution. Therefore, we propose a semi-automated and interactive configuration solution for CPSs. We started our research by analyzing the characteristics of three industrial CPS product lines and constraints required for supporting such a configuration solution. Then we conducted some pilot experiments on applying search algorithms to find optimal decision orders for configuring a product. In this poster, we describe the whole research idea and, discsusion on the work we have completed, the initial results, and the future plan.",

As a result, managing and understanding these systems collaboratively poses unnecessary challenges to end users. In this research, we studied and developed visualization and collaboration techniques to facilitate comprehension and management of engineering information systems with great complexity. Existing commercial and research visualization developments only address applications in specific domains. This paper introduces two techniques applicable to large-scale models across various domains and integrated within a web-based modeling platform, WebGME. The techniques presented are 1) domain-specific visualization that allows representation of components in each domain with conventional or meaningful icons, and 2) model connectivity abstraction that allows domain independent, context-aware abstraction of model connections.",

      "Abstract": "Existing techniques for developing large scale complex engineering systems are predominantly software based and use Unified Modeling Language (UML). This leads to difficulties in model transformation, analysis, validation, verification and automatic code generation. Currently no general frameworks are available to bridge the concept-code gap rampant in design and development of complex, software-intensive mechatronic systems called cyber-physical systems. To fill this gap and provide an alternative approach to Object Management Group's UML/SysML/OCL combination, we propose: Bond Graph based Unified Meta-Modeling Framework (BG-UMF). BG-UMF is a practical and viable alternative and uses a novel hybrid approach based on model unification and integration. The focus is on conceptual design and development of executable models for large systems. The viability of the framework is demonstrated through an application scenario: conceptual design and development of a navigation and control system for a rotor-craft UAV.",

      "Title": "Information Realignment in Pursuit of Self-Sustainable Interoperability at the Digital and Sensing Enterprise",
      "Abstract": "In order to remain competitive with big corporations, small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) often need to be more dynamic, adapt to new business situations, react faster, and thereby survive in today's global economy. To do so, SMEs normally seek to create consortiums become aligned with the new Internet trends, thus gaining access to new and more opportunities. However, this strategy may also lead to complications, especially at the level of interoperability. Systems become more and more dynamic with evolving information models and \"liquid\" semantic domains with fuzzy boundaries. Collaboration networks and partnerships frequently change to answer new customer's requirements, causing new interoperability problems and a reduction of efficiency when not solved. A similar situation is occurring at the level of IoT with the replacement of devices from different manufacturers. This work proposes a mediator system to enable self-sustainable interoperability, monitoring existing enterprise information systems and their devices, by predicting future behaviors and automatically detecting past changes that may harness interoperability. With this, network harmonization disruptions are detected in a timely way, and possible solutions are suggested to regain the interoperable status, thus enhancing robustness for reaching sustainability of business networks along time.",

      "Title": "Disciplined Heterogeneous Modeling",
      "Abstract": "Complex systems demand diversity in the modeling mechanisms. One way to deal with a diversity of requirements is to create flexible modeling frameworks that can be adapted to cover the field of interest. The downside of this approach is a weakening of the semantics of the modeling frameworks that compromises interoperability, understandability, and analyzability of the models. An alternative approach is to embrace heterogeneity and to provide mechanisms for a diversity of models to interact. This paper reviews an approach that achieves such interaction between diverse models using an abstract semantics, which is a deliberately incomplete semantics that cannot by itself define a useful modeling framework. It instead focuses on the interactions between diverse models, reducing the nature of those interactions to a minimum that achieves a well-defined composition. An example of such an abstract semantics is the actor semantics, which can handle many heterogeneous models that are built today, and some that are not common today. The actor abstract semantics and many concrete semantics have been implemented in Ptolemy II, an open-source software framework distributed under a BSD-style license. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",

      "Abstract": "The adoption of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) is regarded as an approach to reduce the accidental complexity of software systems development. The availability of sophisticated language workbenches facilitates the development of DSLs making them increasingly more popular. The adoption of DSLs at large comes at the risk that a poorly designed DSL can be too hard to adopt by its domain users. As such, Usability is one of the essential characteristics to mitigate this risk as it has an important impact on the productivity achieved by DSL users. The current state of practice in Software Language Engineering (SLE) neglects the Usability of DSLs. A pertinent research question in SLE is how to engineer Usability into DSLs systematically. We argue that a timely systematic approach based on User Interface experimental evaluation techniques should be used to assess the impact of DSLs during their development process, while the cost of fixing the usability problems is relatively small, when compared to fixing them at the end of the development process. For that purpose, we introduce a conceptual framework, called USE-ME, which supports the iterative incremental development process of DSLs concerning the issue of their Usability evaluation. We illustrate the feasibility of the approach on a case study of the development of a DSL meant for children to program robots.",

      "Title": "Linking abstract analysis to concrete design: A hierarchical approach to verify medical CPS safety",
      "Abstract": "To manage design complexity and provide verification tractability, models of complex cyber-physical systems are typically hierarchically organized into multiple abstraction layers. Formal reasoning about such systems, therefore, usually involves multiple modeling formalisms, verification paradigms, and associated tools. System properties verified using an abstract component specification in one paradigm must be shown to logically follow from properties verified - possibly using a different paradigm - on a more concrete component description. As component specifications at one layer of abstraction get elaborated into more concrete component descriptions at the next lower level, abstraction induced differences come to the fore; differences that have to be reconciled. In this paper, we present an approach to tie together distinct verification paradigms and reconcile these abstraction induced differences using a medical device cyber-physical system as an example. While the specifics are particular to the example at hand, we believe the techniques are applicable in similar situations for verifying cyber-physical system properties. © 2014 IEEE.",

From this perspective, SIMTHESys (Structured Infrastructure for Multiformalism modeling and Testing of Heterogeneous formalisms and Extensions for SYStems) is a new approach to the specification of performability oriented formalisms and the evaluation of models. Its originality emerges from the explicit definition of both syntax and evolution semantics of the considered formalism elements. The solution of models is made possible by using a set of non-specialized solving engines used to generate automatically formalism-specific reusable solvers. This paper explains how formalisms can be created in SIMTHESys by showing how three widely known modeling languages are successfully implemented. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

To unleash the full potential, the contained systems must be able to operate as elements in open, dynamic, and deviating SoS architectures and to adapt to open and dynamic contexts while being developed, operated, evolved, and governed independently. We name the resulting advanced SoS to be smart as they must be self-adaptive at the level of the individual systems and self-organizing at the SoS level to cope with the emergent behavior at that level. In this paper we analyze the open challenges for the envisioned smart SoS. In addition, we discuss our ideas for tackling this vision with our SMARTSOS approach that employs open and adaptive collaborations and models at runtime. In particular, we focus on preliminary ideas for the construction and assurance of smart SoS.",

      "Abstract": "Cyber–physical systems (CPSs) couple their cyber and physical parts to provide mission-critical services, including automated pervasive health care, smart electricity grid, green cloud computing, and surveillance with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). CPSs can use the information available from the physical environment to provide such ubiquitous, energy-efficient and low-cost functionalities. Their operation needs to ensure three key properties, collectively referred to as S3: 1) safety: avoidance of hazards; 2) security: assurance of integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of information; and 3) sustainability: maintenance of long-term operation of CPSs using green sources of energy. Ensuring S3 properties in a CPS is a challenging task given the spatio–temporal dynamics of the underlying physical environment. In this paper, the formal underpinnings of recent CPS S3 solutions are aligned together in a theoretical framework for cyber–physical interactions, empowering CPS researchers to systematically design solutions for ensuring safety, security, or sustainability. The general applicability of this framework is demonstrated with various exemplar solutions for S3 in diverse CPS domains. Further, insights are provided on some of the open research problems for ensuring S3 in CPSs.",

Given the recurring cycles in the AI history, we expect that a revamp of technologies often tagged as “classical AI”—in particular, logic-based ones—will take place in the next few years. On the other hand, agents and multi-agent systems (MAS) have been at the core of the design of intelligent systems since their very beginning, and their long-term connection with logic-based technologies, which characterised their early days, might open new ways to engineer explainable intelligent systems. This is why understanding the current status of logic-based technologies for MAS is nowadays of paramount importance. Accordingly, this paper aims at providing a comprehensive view of those technologies by making them the subject of a systematic literature review (SLR). The resulting technologies are discussed and evaluated from two different perspectives: the MAS and the logic-based ones.",

      "Abstract": "High-level modelling languages and standards, such as Simulink, UML, SysML, MARTE and AADL (Architecture Analysis & Design Language), meet increasing adoption in the design of embedded systems in order to carry out system-level analysis, verification and validation (V&V) and architecture exploration, as early as possible. These analysis, V&V, architecture exploration techniques rely on mathematical foundations and formal methods in order to avoid semantics ambiguities in the design of safety-critical systems. In order to support integration validation, it is necessary to define a formal framework of virtual prototyping to integrate, verify, exercise and analyse the application code generated by modelling tools as early as possible and virtually integrate it with simulators of third-party middleware and hardware. Such a virtual prototyping platform makes it possible to validate the expected behaviour of the final application software and check that the resulting system indeed meets the specified performance requirements before the actual hardware even actually exists. In this paper, we present the definition, development and case-study validation of such a comprehensive framework, based on the synchronous paradigm and the polychronous model of computation and communication of its supportive open-source toolset: Polychrony. A longer-term aim of our work is to equip the AADL standard with an architecture-centric framework allowing for synchronous modelling, verification and synthesis of embedded software.",

DEVS offers the ability, via mathematical transformations called system morphisms, to map a system expressed in a formalism suitable for analysis (e.g., timed automata or hybrid automata) into the DEVS formalism for the purpose of simulation. We discuss a probabilistic extension of the FD-DEVS formalism that enables a set of model classes and tools derived from Markov-type models. The MS4 modelling environment provides a suite of tools that support this extension, called FP-DEVS. In this paper, we describe these tools and the concepts underlying them. We also provide examples of application of these concepts and discuss the open opportunities for research in this direction.",

      "Title": "Formal Methods for Aerospace Systems",
      "Abstract": "The size and complexity of control software in aerospace systems is rapidly increasing, and this development complicates its validation within the context of the overall spacecraft system. Classical validation methods are both labour intensive and error prone as they rely on manual analysis, review and inspection. Thus there is a growing trend to incorporate the use of automated formal methods. This chapter introduces the ESA-funded COMPASS project, which aims at an integrated system-software co-engineering approach focusing on a coherent set of specification and analysis techniques for evaluation of system-level correctness, safety, dependability and performability of on-board computer-based aerospace systems. Its modelling features and supporting toolset provide a unifying framework for system validation, employing state-of-the-art temporal-logic model checking techniques for infinite-state transition systems, both qualitative and probabilistic, with extensions to fault detection, identification and recovery (FDIR) and safety analysis. We provide an overview of the technology and of the results that have been achieved so far, and address several challenges for future developments. Current efforts of the project consortium concentrate on improving and advancing both process as well as technology of the COMPASS approach, with the goal of bringing the methods to higher levels of technology readiness.",

      "Abstract": "Möbius 2.3 is an extensible dependability, security, and performance modeling environment for large-scale discrete-event systems. It provides multiple model formalisms and solution techniques, facilitating the representation of each part of a system in the formalism that is most appropriate for it, and the application of the solution method or methods best-suited to estimating the system's behavior. Since its initial release in 2001, many advances have been made in Möbius's design and implementation that have strengthened its place in the modeling and analysis community. With almost a decade of widespread academic and industrial use, Möbius has proven itself to be useful in a wide variety of modeling situations. This paper documents the current feature set of Möbius 2.3, emphasizing recent significant enhancements. ©2009 IEEE.",

      "Title": "Structure and classification of unified energy agents as a base for the systematic development of future energy grids",
      "Abstract": "The ongoing conversion of our energy supply encounters a great interest of many different market players that were originally located in different industries. As a consequence, a vast amount of proprietary solutions for \"smart\" energy applications is flooding the market. This tends to be rather a problem than part of the solution for the systematic development of future energy grids. Here, the absence of necessary unifications and standards blocks further developments that would enable the creation of novel, market-driven and hybrid control solutions for various types of technical systems. To overcome these problems, we present in this article our notion and the definition of a unified autonomous software entity that we call Energy Agent. Based on the energy conservation law and a generalized energy option model, we claim that our Energy Agent approach has the capabilities to enable cross domain interactions between different types of energy systems and networks. Further we will outline a systematic development process for Energy Agents that considers implementation, simulation, test-bed application and a real on-site usage. By taking into account these development stages, we expect to concurrently develop a novel laboratory that enables to competitively test and validate new and hybrid control solutions before they are applied in real systems.",

      "Abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) represent a new class of information system that also takes real-world data and effects into account. Software-controlled sensors, actuators and smart objects enable a close coupling of the cyber and physical worlds. Introducing processes into CPS to automate repetitive tasks promises advantages regarding resource utilization and flexibility of control systems for smart spaces. However, process execution systems face new challenges when being adapted for process execution in CPS: the automated processing of sensor events and data, the dynamic invocation of services, the integration of human interaction, and the synchronization of the cyber and physical worlds. Current workflow engines fulfill these requirements only to a certain degree. In this work, we present PROtEUS—an integrated system for process execution in CPS. PROtEUS integrates components for event processing, data routing, dynamic service selection and human interaction on the modeling and execution level. It is the basis for executing self-healing model-based workflows in CPS. We demonstrate the applicability of PROtEUS within two case studies from the Smart Home domain and discuss its feasibility for introducing workflows into cyber-physical systems.",

For the diversity of embedded environment, it happens that one simulation model developed under a specific platform need to be transplant to another platform when the environment changes. This paper aims to make a brief study of the design and realization method of a configurable environment simulation tool for embedded software. Some kinds of interactive environment models are realized by S-function, which could be integrated into embedded software model for simulation. A configurable simulation monitor interface are designed so that needed monitor interface could be build easily for different user requirement. To improve the effect of simulation data acquisition, a new simulation monitor method is presented. The simulation result shows that this method is feasible and effective. By integrated the modeling function of Matlab/Simulink, This tool could support the whole stage of modeling, simulation and monitoring for embedded software.",

      "Abstract": "The Two-hemisphere model-driven (2HMD) approach assumes modelling and use of procedural and conceptual knowledge on an equal and related basis. This differentiates 2HMD approach from pure procedural, pure conceptual, and object oriented approaches. The approach may be applied in the context of modelling of a particular business domain as well as in the context of modelling the knowledge about the domain. Cyber-physical systems are heterogeneous systems, which require multi-disciplinary approach to their modelling. Modelling of cyber-physical systems by 2HMD approach gives an opportunity to transparently compose and analyse system components to be provided and components actually provided, and, thus, to identify and fill the gaps between desirable and actual system content.",

      "Title": "Architecting dynamic cyber-physical spaces",
      "Abstract": "We increasingly live in cyber-physical spaces: spaces that are both physical and digital, and where the two aspects are intertwined. Cyber-physical spaces may exhibit a range of behaviors, from smart control of heating, ventilation, and light to visionary multi-functional living spaces that can be spatially re-organized in a dynamic way. In contrast to traditional physical environments, cyber-physical spaces often exhibit dynamic behaviors: they can change over time and react to changes occurring in space. Current design of spaces, however, does not normally accommodate the cyber aspects of modern spatial environments and does not capture their dynamic behavior. Spatial design, although done with CAD tools and following certain international processes and standards, such as Building Information Modelling (BIM), largely produces syntactic descriptions of spaces which lack dynamic semantics. As a consequence, designs cannot be automatically (and formally) analyzed with respect to various requirements emerging from dynamic cyber-physical spaces; safety, security or reliability requirements being typical examples of this. This paper will show an avenue for research which can be characterized as rethinking the design of spatial environments, i.e., dynamic cyber-physical spaces, from a software engineering perspective. We outline our approach where formally analyzable models may be automatically extracted from BIM depending on the analysis required, and then checked against formally specified requirements, both regarding static and dynamic properties of the design, prior to the construction phase (at design time). To realize automated operational management, these models can also be used during operation to continuously check satisfaction of the requirements when changes occur, and possibly enforce their satisfaction through self-adaptive strategies (at run-time).",

      "Abstract": "Critical Computer-Based systems have an increasing complexity due to the number of components, to their heterogeneity, and to the relationships among them. Such systems must meet strict non-functional requirements and should be able to cope with competitive market needs. The adoption of formal methods is often advocated in order to provide formal proof, but their application does not scale with the growing size of systems. The aim of this chapter is to introduce a modelling and analysis methodology that allows the combination of three proven research trends in formal modelling of large systems: formal model generation (by means of model-driven techniques), multiformalism, and compositional approaches. In this chapter there is also a discussion about enabling techniques. The proposed approach has been applied to the performability modelling and evaluation of flexible manufacturing systems.",

These devices are typically battery powered and expected to deliver a safe and reliable service to the patient regardless of its power reserves. Being energy efficient brings an additional level of complexity to the development of these solutions. In this paper we propose the application of a well-founded model-driven energy-aware approach to tackle the energy consumption in such solutions addressing all their critical subsystems: control software, communication and mechanical components. The approach enables exploration of the design space, reduces prototyping costs and helps in build confidence in the proposed solution. We demonstrate this approach in a case study focused on the development of an intelligent compression stocking to treat leg-venous insufficiency. We also discuss how this approach has benefited the development of the actual device.",

The proposed methodology discloses the opportunity of improving the cost-efficiency of the development process by providing automated support to identify viable design solutions with respect to selected non-functional requirements. To this end, it leverages the interplay of modeling languages for the vehicular domain whose integration is achieved by a suite of model transformations. An instantiation of the methodology is discussed for timing requirements, which are among the most critical ones for vehicular systems. To support the design of temporally correct systems, cooperation between EAST-ADL and the Rubus component model is opportunely built-up by means of model transformations, enabling timing-Aware design and model-based timing analysis of the system. The applicability of the methodology is demonstrated as the proof of concepts on industrial use cases performed in cooperation with our industrial partners.",

      "Abstract": "Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) aims to provide a systems engineering methodology that leverages modeling methods to support design, analysis, verification, and validation of systems. As such, methodologies for MBSE have to be able to integrate heterogeneous engineering models from a variety of domains, including mechanical engineering, product design, legislation, and many more. Most research in this area usually only focuses on general system descriptions of a step in the system development process, without providing any interdisciplinary or interprocess connections. Thus, the models created by the domain experts are often unconnected and not suited for automated model transformations. We present a method to integrate abstract system descriptions in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models, which are not only the primary model for geometrical hardware descriptions but also the starting point of most process chains in the context of virtual product development. The transformations of our method are realized in a plug-in for the MagicDraw modeling environment and support to generate parameters of a parameter and constraint CAD modeling approach from a SysML model. This automates the integration of abstract system descriptions with design models to foster a coherent virtual product development.",

      "Abstract": "This paper presents our early-stage research on a Multi-Paradigm Modeling (MPM) approach as an initial step towards the definition of a Digital Twin (DT) for Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). This work takes place in the context of the digitalization of the mail sorting process at La Poste, the French national postal service company. Indeed, La Poste is currently investing on robotics modules for automatically loading mail containers. The main objective is to reduce the painful work for human operators while optimizing the robots usage. We already worked on targeting such a balance in a past effort that resulted in the production of different kinds of models of the La Poste CPPS. However, these models were defined separately and are not directly related to the underlying business process in particular. Thus, we propose an MPM approach starting from this business process as now modeled explicitly in a BPMN model. Then, we refine the high-level business activities into finer-grained activities represented in a UML Activity model. From these latest, we derive the specification of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) developed with the JADE framework and emulating the behavior of the La Poste CPPS. Our longer term objective is to pave the way for supporting the definition of a DT for this CPPS, and potentially for other CPPSs in different contexts in the future.",

We then compare these tools using a number of particular facets, where each facet belongs to one of six different categories and may contain several attributes. The results of the study are discussed in detail and made publicly available in a companion website with a capability to search for tools using the specified facets as search criteria.

      "Title": "Ontology Supporting Model-Based Systems Engineering Based on a GOPPRR Approach",
      "Abstract": "Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) has become a new trend in systems engineering. The core of MBSE is the use of models to formalize product development and the product itself (requirement, architecture, etc.) using different languages throughout the entire lifecycle. However, different tools based on different modeling languages in each development phase lead to considerable deviations during information sharing between the models. In this paper, a GOPPRR approach is proposed to describe system characteristics and system development based on meta-models for different architecture descriptions using meta-meta models including Graph, Object, Point, Property, Role, and Relationship. Moreover, ontology based on W3C Web Ontology LanguageÂ (OWL) is designed to support the GOPPRR approach for unified model representations and further to implement model integration in the entire lifecycle. Finally, the feasibility of the GOPPRR approach and the ontology formalism supporting MBSE is verified through an auto-braking case of an autonomous driving system.",

      "Abstract": "Simulation modeling has always gained higher priority than pure theoretical analysis and real experimentation to evaluate the effectiveness of combat systems. This approach is a classical physics-based method in which a model represents casual relationships. Inspired from artificial intelligence, many researchers have paid much attention to the complementary use of data modeling, a data-driven method that represents correlations. Combined model and data, one benefits from the advantages of both methods, generalization capabilities and better accuracy. This paper discusses ways in which the two methods have been used together and proposes a generic framework showing how they can be applied to various phases of combat effectiveness simulation modeling process. As a proof of concept, a case study of joint antisubmarine is illustrated as a demonstration.",

      "Abstract": "Smart system applications (SSAs)—a heterogeneous landscape of applications of Internet of things, cyber-physical systems, and smart sensing systems—are composed of autonomous yet inherently cooperating components. An important problem in this area is how to hoist the cooperation of software components forming dynamic groups—ensembles—at the architectural level of an SSA. This is hard since ensembles can overlap, be nested, and be dynamically formed and dismantled based on several criteria. A related problem is how to combine component and ensemble specification with a well-established language supported on multiple platforms. To target these problems, we propose a specification and implementation language Trait-based COmponent Ensemble Language (TCOEL) based on Scala internal DSL, to describe both the architecture and formation of dynamic ensembles of components and their functional internals. To raise the level of expressivity, we introduce the concept of domain-specific extensions (traits) to the TCOEL core to reflect different paradigms’ concerns—such as movement in a 2D map, state-space modeling of physical processes, and statistical reasoning about uncertainty. This allows for configuring TCOEL for the needs of a specific SSA use case and, at the same time, facilitates reuse. To evaluate TCOEL, we show how it can be beneficially used in addressing the coordination of agents in a RoboCup Rescue Simulation application.",

      "Abstract": "Model-driven engineering can be used to create problem-specific, conceptual models abstracting away unwanted details. Models at runtime take this principle to the time a system is running. Connecting and synchronizing multiple models creates several problems. Usually, models used at runtime must communicate with other systems over the network, they are often based on different paradigms, and in most settings a fast and reactive behaviour is required. We aim for a structured way to define and organize such connections in order to minimize development cost, network usage and computation effort while maximizing interoperability. In order to achieve those goals, we present an extension of the paradigm of models based on reference attribute grammars by creating a dedicated problem-specific language for those connections. We show how to connect several runtime models to a robotic system in order to control this robot and to provide guarantees for safe coexistence with nearby humans. We show, that using our approach, connections can be specified more concisely while maintaining the same efficiency as hand-written code.",

      "Abstract": "In today's engineering projects, companies continuously have to adapt their systems to changing customers or dynamic market requirements. This requires a flexible, iterative development process in which different parts of the system under construction are built and updated concurrently. However, concurrent engineering becomes quite challenging in domains where different engineering artifacts from different disciplines come into play, such as safety-critical cyber-physical systems, where the involved engineering artifacts are quite heterogeneous in nature. In such systems, it is of utmost importance that different artifacts remain consistent in order to guarantee a correctly functioning end product. In this article, we discuss our experiences (with a leading company working in the areas of production automation and product processing) in maintaining the consistency between electrical models and the corresponding software controller, when both are subject to continuous changes. The article discusses how we let engineers describe the relationships between electrical models and the corresponding software controller code in the form of links and consistency rules. Additionally, we demonstrate that how our approach, through a process of continuous consistency checking, notifies engineers about the erroneous impact of their changes in various engineering artifacts.",

This paper presents an approach for modeling and analyzing cyber physical systems using high level Petri nets. We provide several patterns for modeling various behavioral features including discrete, continuous, synchronous, and real-time. Our modeling approach starts with modeling individual system components as agent nets using the patterns, and then weaving the agent nets incrementally using the aspect-oriented idea to obtain an overall system net. The approach is introduced and discussed through an airplane fuel tank system and is applied to an airplane landing detection controlling system in the case study section. Three complementary analysis techniques including simulation, reachability analysis, and model checking are used for analyzing high level Petri net models. Our approach is supported with a tool chain for model construction and analysis.",

      "Title": "Hybrid models as transdisciplinary research enablers",
      "Abstract": "Modelling and simulation (M&S) techniques are frequently used in Operations Research (OR) to aid decision-making. With growing complexity of systems to be modelled, an increasing number of studies now apply multiple M&S techniques or hybrid simulation (HS) to represent the underlying system of interest. A parallel but related theme of research is extending the HS approach to include the development of hybrid models (HM). HM extends the M&S discipline by combining theories, methods and tools from across disciplines and applying multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary solutions to practice. In the broader OR literature, there are numerous examples of cross-disciplinary approaches in model development. However, within M&S, there is limited evidence of the application of conjoined methods for building HM. Where a stream of such research does exist, the integration of approaches is mostly at a technical level. In this paper, we argue that HM requires cross-disciplinary research engagement and a conceptual framework. The framework will enable the synthesis of discipline-specific methods and techniques, further cross-disciplinary research within the M&S community, and will serve as a transcending framework for the transdisciplinary alignment of M&S research with domain knowledge, hypotheses and theories from diverse disciplines. The framework will support the development of new composable HM methods, tools and applications. Although our framework is built around M&S literature, it is generally applicable to other disciplines, especially those with a computational element. The objective is to motivate a transdisciplinarity-enabling framework that supports the collaboration of research efforts from multiple disciplines, allowing them to grow into transdisciplinary research.",

With the goal of making models as precise, simple and reusable as possible, we augment DSLs with concepts from multilevel modelling, where the number of abstraction levels are not limited. This is particularly useful for DSL definitions with behaviour, whose concepts inherently belong to different levels of abstraction. Here, models can represent the state of the modelled system and evolve using model transformations. These transformations can benefit from a multilevel setting, becoming a precise and reusable definition of the semantics for behavioural modelling languages. We present in this paper the concept of Multilevel Coupled Model Transformations, together with examples, formal definitions and tools to assess their conceptual soundness and practical value.",

Establishing an engineering model for system of systems is essential for representing operational and managerial independence of component systems and their interactions leading to emergent and evolutionary development of system of systems with enhanced composite capabilities. This article contributes to system of systems modeling of physical component systems and organizational component systems. We propose a data-centric model for supervision of system of systems. A concrete example is discussed composed of two cooperating component systems, an unmanned aerial vehicle and an intelligent autonomous road vehicle, in which the unmanned aerial vehicle acts as an external global positioning system sensor that supplies redundant navigation information to the intelligent autonomous road vehicle, to be able to safely maneuver in a confined space.",

In this publication we present a case study of the development of the Continuous REactive SysTems language (CREST), a DSL for hybrid systems modeling. The language focuses on the representation of continuous resource flows such as water, electricity, light or heat. Our methodology follows a very pragmatic approach, combining the syntactic and semantic principles of well-known modeling means such as hybrid automata, data-flow languages and architecture description languages into a coherent language. The borrowed aspects have been carefully combined and formalised in a well-defined operational semantics. The DSL provides two concrete syntaxes: CREST diagrams, a graphical language that is easily understandable and serves as a model basis, and crestdsl, an internal DSL implementation that supports rapid prototyping—both are geared towards usability and clarity. We present the DSL’s semantics, which thoroughly connect the various language concerns into an executable formalism that enables sound simulation and formal verification in crestdsl, and discuss the lessons learned throughout the project.",

      "Title": "FASTEN: An Open Extensible Framework to Experiment with Formal Specification Approaches",
      "Abstract": "Formal specification approaches have been successfully used to specify and verify complex systems. Verification engineers so far either directly use formal specification languages which can be consumed by verification tools (e.g. SMV, Promela) or main stream modeling languages which are then translated into formal languages and verified (e.g. SysML, AADL). The first approach is expressive and effective but difficult to use by non-experts. The second approach lowers the entry barrier for novices but users are limited to the constructs of the chosen modeling languages and thereby end up abusing the language to encode behaviors of interest. In this paper, we introduce a third approach that we call FASTEN, in which modular and extensible Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) are used to raise the abstraction level of specification languages towards the domain of interest. The approach aims to help novice users to use formal specification, enable experts to use multi-paradigm modeling, and provide tools for the developers of verification technologies to easily experiment with various types of specification approaches. To show the feasibility of the approach, we release an open-source tool based on Jetbrains' MPS language workbench that provides an extensible stack of more than ten DSLs, situated at different levels of abstraction, built on top of the SMV language. We use the NuSMV model checker to perform verification, to simulate the models and lift the traces at the abstraction level of the DSLs. We detail on the experience with designing and developing the DSLs stack and briefly report on using the DSLs in practice for the study of a communication protocol of a safety critical system.",

      "Abstract": "Reducing the energy consumption of a complex, especially cyber-physical, system is a cross-cutting concern through the system layers, and typically requires long feedback loops between experts in several engineering disciplines. Having an immediate automatic estimation of the global system consumption at design-time would significantly accelerate this process, but cross-layer tools are missing in several domains. Executable domain-specific modeling languages (xDSLs) can be used to design several layers of the system under development in an integrated view. By including the behavioral specification for software and physical components of the system, they are an effective source artifact for cross-layer energy estimation. In this paper we propose EEL, a language for annotating xDSL primitives with energy-related properties, i.e. how their execution would contribute to the energy consumption on a specific runtime platform. Given an xDSL, energy specialists create EEL models of that xDSL for each considered runtime platform. The models are used at design time, to predict the energy consumption of the real systems. This avoids the need of energetic analysis by deployment and measurement on all runtime platforms, that is slow and expensive. We augment an existing language workbench for xDSLs with an editor for EEL models and a component that computes energy-consumption estimations during model editing. The evaluation shows that EEL can be used to represent estimation models from literature, and provide useful predictions.",

      "Abstract": "Co-simulation is a powerful technique for performing full-system simulation. Multiple black-box models and their simulators are combined together to provide the behaviour for a full system. However, the black-box nature of co-simulation and potentially infinite configuration space means that configuration of co-simulations is a challenging problem for today’s practitioners. Our previous work on co-simulation configuration operated on the notion of hints, which allow system engineers to encode their knowledge and insights about the system. These hints, combined with state-of-the-art best practices, can then be used to semi-automatically configure the co-simulation. We summarize our previous hint-based configuration work here, and explore the challenging problem of scheduling co-simulations which contain algebraic loops. Solving or “breaking” these loops is required for scheduling, yet this breaking process can induce errors in the co-simulation. This work formalizes this scheduling problem, presents our insights gained about the problem, and details an optimal search algorithm as well as greedy scheduling algorithms. These heuristic algorithms are evaluated on (synthetic) co-simulation scenarios to determine their relative speedup and optimality.",

      "Abstract": "Model-based approaches are essential for designing cyber-physical systems, which adopt the formal models to simultaneously form the specifications and enable the verification at an early stage. Aimed to model the complex structure and continuous-discrete hybrid behavior of cyber-physical systems, this paper mathematically defines a dynamic relational system so that the cyber-physical system can be regarded as dynamic relational systems in a hierarchical structure and each dynamical relational system is a triple of dynamic attributes, subsystems, and hybrid relations between attributes and subsystems. Every hybrid relation contains a tuple and a predicate to govern the system behaviors. By utilizing the dynamic relational system, a parametric abstraction is then performed to specify the design requirements and schemes. It can represent the structure and behaviors of multiple cyber-physical system design schemes in an integrated manner. With a mathematical foundation, the constructed relational models are beneficial for structural analysis and behavior verification. An implementation case of a friction-driven plate conveyor is presented to illustrate the design specification with relational models, and the connectivity analysis and behavior verifications are carried out to show the effectiveness and engineering practicability of the achieved models.",

      "Abstract": "An adaptive system can modify its settings at runtime as a response to changes in its operational environment. To analyse this kind of systems at design time is a difficult task since it requires considering the system together with the adaptation operations, and taking into account how such adaptations act on the system. In order to use simulation-based techniques for the analysis of such systems, we not only need precise executable models of the systems to be analyzed, but also to capture the semantics of their adaptation mechanisms. Given the wide range and flexibility of adaptation operations, we need ways to allow the definition of new operations. We present a flexible approach for the definition and simulation-based analysis in design-time of adaptive component-based systems. Our approach combines an extension of the Palladio component model in e-Motions, a model of the adaptation mechanisms, and elastic requirements specification using the SYBL language. From the model of the system, its adaptation mechanisms, and its requirements, an executable Maude specification is generated for simulation. The application of the approach is illustrated on a use case that comprises some components and adaptations rules. The example is then analyzed using simulations. It is also shown that it is indeed possible to define additional metrics, specify adaptation requirements and rules which conduct simulations of the models in a more flexible way, and that the results of the simulation performed from these definitions can be used to carry on a valuable predictive performance analysis.",

      "Title": "Chapter 8 - Agent-based cyber-physical system development with SEA_ML++",
      "Abstract": "Intelligent agents are software components that can work autonomously and proactively to solve the problems collaboratively. To this end, they can behave in a cooperative manner and collaborate with other agents constituting systems called Multi-agent Systems (MAS). These systems have different perspectives such as the internal structure, plan, interaction, organisation, role, environment and so on. By having these views, MASs can consider the structure, behaviour, interaction, and environment of the complex systems such as Cyber-physical Systems (CPS). Therefore, intelligent software agents and MASs can be used in the modelling and development of CPSs. There are different Domain-specific Modelling Languages (DSMLs) to build MASs with a focus on various MAS aspects. One of the generative MAS DSMLs is SEA_ML++ which presents a thorough Model-driven Engineering practice with including the abstract syntax, graphical concrete syntax, model-to-model transformations and model-to-code transformations with the support of Platform Independent and Platform Specific levels of MAS modelling. In this chapter, we discuss how SEA_ML++ is used for the design and implementation of agent-based CPSs. An MDE methodology is introduced in which SEA_ML++ can be used to design agent-based CPS and implement these systems on various agent execution platforms. As the evaluating case study, the development of a multi-agent garbage collection CPS is taken into consideration. The conducted study demonstrates how this CPS can be designed according to the various viewpoints of SEA_ML++ and then implemented and executed on Jason platform.",

      "Abstract": "Model-driven engineering can be used to create problem-specific, conceptual models abstracting away unwanted details. Models at runtime take this principle to the time a system is running. Connecting and synchronizing multiple models creates several problems. Usually, models used at runtime must communicate with other systems over the network, they are often based on different paradigms, and in most settings a fast and reactive behaviour is required. We aim for a structured way to define and organize such connections in order to minimize development cost, network usage and computation effort while maximizing interoperability. In order to achieve those goals, we present an extension of the paradigm of models based on reference attribute grammars by creating a dedicated problem-specific language for those connections. We show how to connect several runtime models to a robotic system in order to control this robot and to provide guarantees for safe coexistence with nearby humans. We show, that using our approach, connections can be specified more concisely while maintaining the same efficiency as hand-written code.",

      "Abstract": "Home automation is a promising market application and a very interesting area of research in the field of automation, where human–machine integration is a key issue. The history of home automation, however, can be traced through various phases since its inception: first, with concepts and equipment inherited from industry automation, then to a phase in which new tools were developed but problems were encountered with design, and finally to a new era where the challenge is to further explore a multidisciplinary approach that conceives of home automation as a service, with a different model for the interaction between the home and its users. In this new phase, the design challenges are quite different, as is the motivation for implementing new architectures for building and residential automation (B&RA). In this article we present a direct comparison between the last two phases of home automation, as described above, and propose a new methodology for designing B&RA systems based on an anthropocentric automation approach. A design discipline for improving integration is applied to models developed at the beginning of this century, achieving good results. This same model is then compared with a new approach, revealing new challenges that could arise in both integration and service. To better understand all of the differences, the older approach is presented along with a case study implemented in Portugal. It introduces new concepts and challenges for B&RAs in implementing sustainable houses and buildings that are also capable of generating energy—as in the urban smart grid. Another important challenge is improving integration with users in terms of service systems.",

      "Abstract": "Model-based System Engineering (MBSE) is a methodology that uses models throughout the engineering to replace the paper-based approach of communication among stakeholders. Multi-Paradigm Modelling (MPM) is at the core of this engineering approach as for each phase in the engineering process the most appropriate models at the most appropriate levels of abstraction is used. A design process includes a set of activities in which the design decisions or evaluations of the (sub-) system properties are done. Furthermore, the design artifacts are transformed by the design activities.We can define transformations as the manipulation of a model with a specific purpose. MPM approaches do not have a standard way of representing processes. A process model for MPM should focus on the languages, model instances and transformations between these models at different levels of abstraction. In this chapter, we propose the Formalism Transformation Graph and Process Model (FTG+PM) as a standard representation of MPM processes. The described process can be simulated for analysis and orchestration, as a set of (automatic) transformations.",

      "Abstract": "The huge variety of smart devices and their communication models increases the development complexity of embedded software for the Internet of Things. As a consequence, development of these systems becomes more complex, error-prone, and costly. To tackle this problem, in this study, a model-driven approach is proposed for the development of Contiki-based IoT systems. To this end, the Contiki metamodel available in the literature is extended to include elements of WiFi connectivity modules (such as ESP8266), IoT Log Manager, and information processing components (such as Raspberry Pi). Based on this new metamodel, a domain-specific modeling environment is developed in which visual symbols are used and static semantics (representing system constraints) are defined. Also, the architectural code for the computing components of the IoT system such as Contiki, ESP8266, and RaspberryPi are generated from the developer's instance model. Finally, a Smart Fire Detection system is used to evaluate this study. By modeling the Contiki-based IoT system, we support model-driven development of the system, including WSN motes and sink nodes (with ContikiOS), WiFi modules and information processing components.",

      "Title": "Exploiting CloudSim in a multiformalism modeling approach for cloud based systems",
      "Abstract": "Cloud based architectures present many challenges, ranging from poorly dimensioned hardware to lengthy wait times and resource balancing issues. Most of these problems can be mitigated by using proper performance evaluation techniques, depending on the accuracy of the model abstracting the real system. The adoption of a formalism over another to describe the considered infrastructure plays a crucial role in achieving this goal. In this sense, multiformalism proves itself to be a powerful modeling approach describing each system component according to the most suitable representation. This paper presents a novel modeling method oriented to the prediction of cloud architectures performance, suitable for joining the advantages of high level modeling abstractions and of the detail of a specialized simulator. Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets are used to describe the workload and the behavior of users and applications, while Cloudsim, a well known cloud infrastructure simulator, is adopted for the cloud part. A case study of a simplified Edge Computing application is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

      "Title": "Formal specification and verification of reusable communication models for distributed systems architecture",
      "Abstract": "The development of distributed computing systems involves complex concerns related to integrating numerous communication styles, technologies (Internet of Things, cloud, big data, etc.), stakeholders (architects, developers, integrators, etc.) and addressing a multitude of application domains (smart cities, health, mobility, etc.). Existing architectural description languages fail to rigorously bridge the gap between the abstract representation of communication styles and those supported by existing execution infrastructures. In this paper, we propose an approach combining semi-formal and formal languages which considers modeling and formalization from both the structural and communication behavior perspectives. As a prerequisite, we build reusable model libraries to specify and verify communication styles for modeling software architectures of distributed systems. First, we propose a metamodel to describe high-level concepts of architecture in a component–port–connector fashion focusing on different communication styles. Then, we formalize those concepts and their semantics following some properties (specifications) to check architectural conformance. To validate our work, we provide a set of reusable connector libraries within a set of properties to define architectures for systems with explicit communication models that are common to most distributed systems including message passing, remote procedure calls, and distributed shared memory. Through reuse of these specified and verified connectors, we demonstrate how concrete software architectures for a given application domain can be developed.",

This will provide a seamless plug-and-play framework that is highly adaptive and configurable while providing model transformation mechanisms to easily interface with High Level Architecture or other federated simulation protocols. RCAS3 will be built around already existing technologies: Aviation Scenario Definition Language Modeling, Discrete Event System Specification, and System Entity Structure implemented in RTSync’s MS4 Me. These will be augmented with an Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL)-based configuration and behavior analysis suite.

      "Abstract": "Software in modern vehicles consists of multi-criticality functions, where a function can be safety-critical with stringent real-time requirements, less critical from the vehicle operation perspective, but still with real-time requirements, or not critical at all. Next-generation autonomous vehicles will require higher computational power to run multi-criticality functions and such a power can only be provided by parallel computing platforms such as multi-core architectures. However, current model-based software development solutions and related modelling languages have not been designed to effectively deal with challenges specific of multi-core, such as core-interdependency and controlled allocation of software to hardware. In this paper, we report on the evolution of the Rubus Component Model for the modelling, analysis, and development of vehicular software systems with multi-criticality for deployment on multi-core platforms. Our goal is to provide a lightweight and technology-preserving transition from model-based software development for single-core to multi-core. This is achieved by evolving the Rubus Component Model to capture explicit concepts for multi-core and parallel hardware and for expressing variable criticality of software functions. The paper illustrates these contributions through an industrial application in the vehicular domain.",

      "Abstract": "Modern physical protection systems integrate a number of security systems (including procedures, equipments, and personnel) into a single interface to ensure an adequate level of protection of people and critical assets against malevolent human actions. Due to the critical functions of a protection system, the quantitative evaluation of its effectiveness is an important issue that still raises several challenges. In this paper we propose a model-driven approach to support the design and the evaluation of physical protection systems based on (a) UML models representing threats, protection facilities, assets, and relationships among them, and (b) the automatic construction of a Bayesian Network model to estimate the vulnerability of different system configurations. Hence, the proposed approach is useful both in the context of vulnerability assessment and in designing new security systems as it enables what-if and cost–benefit analyses. A real-world case study is further illustrated in order to validate and demonstrate the potentiality of the approach. Specifically, two attack scenarios are considered against the depot of a mass transit transportation system in Milan, Italy.",
