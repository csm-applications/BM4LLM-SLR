The as-molded mesostructure of the complete geometry is captured using material density gradients in 50 µm resolution CT scans without the need to resolve individual fibers. Fiber collimation and physical density gradients within intact platelets of this material system facilitates nondestructive assessment of average local fiber orientation at the component scale. Microscopy-based validation of the local orientation measurements indicate the accuracy that can be attained utilizing the density-based structure tensor CT analysis method. Local orientation field measurements for the complete geometry can be mapped into a “digital twin” model, for purposes such as experimental performance simulation and validation of molding process orientation state predictions.

A Digital Twin is a digital equivalent of a real-life object of which it mirrors its behaviour and states over its lifetime in a virtual space. Using Digital Twins as a central means for farm management enables the decoupling of physical flows from its planning and control. As a consequence, farmers can manage operations remotely based on (near) real-time digital information instead of having to rely on direct observation and manual tasks on-site. This allows them to act immediately in case of (expected) deviations and to simulate effects of interventions based on real-life data. This paper analyses how Digital Twins can advance smart farming. It defines the concept, develops a typology of different types of Digital Twins, and proposes a conceptual framework for designing and implementing Digital Twins. The framework comprises a control model based on a general systems approach and an implementation model for Digital Twin systems based on the Internet of Things—Architecture (IoT-A), a reference architecture for IoT systems. The framework is applied to and validated in five smart farming use cases of the European IoF2020 project, focussing on arable farming, dairy farming, greenhouse horticulture, organic vegetable farming and livestock farming.",Farm management systems | Internet of things | Remote sensing and control | Smart agriculture | Virtualization,Agricultural Systems,2021-04-01,Article,"Verdouw, Cor;Tekinerdogan, Bedir;Beulens, Adrie;Wolfert, Sjaak",Include,

Digital twin is one of the enabling technologies that link actual physical system with its virtual depiction using advanced digital technologies. In order to leverage its potential, firms have instigated to adopt digital twin and physical internet for real-world applications. Although researches on impact of information technology in supply chains exists, a study on the modelling aspects by analysing critical success factors for adoption of digital twin and physical internet is limited. We have addressed this gap by developing a structural model for identifying the inter-relationships and cause effect parameters of critical success factors for adoption of digital twin and physical internet. Thirteen critical success factors were shortlisted based on literature review and in consultation with experts. An integrated Grey- based, decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)is used to visualize the causal relationships among critical success factors and verified by applying the proposed model in an electronics manufacturing firm. Sensitivity analysis has been done to check accuracy of results and robustness of the study. The results reveal that top management commitment and support and long, medium and short term planning are the most influential factors impacting the adoption of digital twin and physical internet in electronics industry.

Due to the high risk of getting affected in high-density population areas and the implementation of national emergency measures under the COVID-19 pandemic, both travel and transportation among cities become difficult for engineers and equipment. Consequently, the costly physical commissioning of a new manufacturing system is greatly hindered. As an emerging technology, digital twins can achieve semi-physical simulation to avoid the vast cost of physical commissioning of the manufacturing system. Therefore, this paper proposes a digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning (DT-RSPC) approach for open architecture flow-type smart manufacturing systems. A digital twin system is developed to enable the remote semi-physical commissioning. The proposed approach is validated through a case study of digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning of a smartphone assembly line. The results showed that combining the open architecture design paradigm with the proposed digital twins-based approach makes the commissioning of a new flow-type smart manufacturing system more sustainable.",COVID-19 pandemic | Digital twins | Manufacturing system commissioning | Remote semi-physical commissioning | Smart manufacturing,Journal of Cleaner Production,2021-07-15,Article,"Leng, Jiewu;Zhou, Man;Xiao, Yuxuan;Zhang, Hu;Liu, Qiang;Shen, Weiming;Su, Qianyi;Li, Longzhang",Include,

This paper presents a cloud battery management system for battery systems to improve the computational power and data storage capability by cloud computing. With the Internet of Things, all battery relevant data are measured and transmitted to the cloud seamlessly, building up the digital twin for the battery system, where battery diagnostic algorithms evaluate the data and open the window into battery's charge and aging level. The application of equivalent circuit models in the digital twin for battery systems is explored with the development of cloud-suited state-of-charge and state-of-health estimation approaches. The proposed state-of-charge estimation with an adaptive extended H-infinity filter is robust and accurate for both lithium-ion and lead-acid batteries, even with a significant initialization error. Furthermore, a state-of-health estimation algorithm with particle swarm optimization is innovatively exploited to monitor both capacity fade and power fade of the battery during aging.

Such layout is not only suitable for producing bulky or fragile products, but also offers considerable flexibility and competitive operational efficiency for products with medium variety and volumes. However, due to inherent complexity of the product, sophisticated assembly operations heavily rely on skilled operators, and the complexity and uncertainty are high and amplified by such massive manual interventions as well as the unique routing patterns of the fixed-position assembly process. Aiming at reducing the complexity and uncertainty, this paper introduces a digital twin-enabled Graduation Intelligent Manufacturing System (DT-GiMS) for fixed-position assembly islands. Inspired by the success of graduation ceremony, an assembly system-Graduation Manufacturing System (GMS) is proposed for fixed-position assembly islands, in which job tickets, setup tickets, operation tickets, and logistics tickets are designed to organize the production activities. Following the concept of digital twin, unified digital representations with appropriate sets of information are created at object level, product level, and system level, respectively. Through Internet of Things (IoT), smart gateway, Web 3D and industrial wearable technologies, vital information including identity, status, geometric model, and production process can be captured and mapped in physical space, and converged and synchronized with their digital representations in twin (cloud) space on a real-time basis. The overall framework of DT-GiMS is presented with physical layer, digital layer, and service layer. Real-time convergence and synchronization among them ensure that right resources are allocated and utilized to the right activities at the right time with enhanced visibility. Considering customer demand and production capacity constraints, real-time ticket pool management mechanisms are proposed to manage production activities in a near-optimal way under DT-GiMS. With the support of cloud-based services provided in service layer in DT-GiMS, managers could easily make production decisions, and onsite operators could efficiently complete their daily tasks with nearly error-free operations with enhanced visibility.

This paper proposes a novel digital twin-driven approach for rapid reconfiguration of automated manufacturing systems.

The results of the optimization part are fed back to the semi-physical simulation for verification. Open-architecture machine tool (OAMT) is defined and developed as a new class of machine tools comprising a fixed standard platform and various individualized modules that can be added and rapidly swapped. Engineers can flexibly reconfigure the manufacturing system for catering to process planning by integrating personalized modules into its OAMTs. Key enabling techniques, including how to twin cyber and physical system and how to quickly bi-level program the production capacity and functionality of manufacturing systems to adapt rapid changes of products, are detailed.

Academics and companies have made great strides in the theoretical research and case studies of constructing the shop-floor digital twin (SDT), which is the premise of applying DT technology on the shop floor. A shop floor is a large complex system that involves many elements including people, machines, materials, methods, and the environment and processes, such as the technical flow, business process, logistics, and control flow. However, most of the developed cases lack a hierarchical, structured and modularized implementation framework for the development of an SDT system, which leads to problems such as a low reuse rate of the system blocks, lack of scalability, and high upgrade and maintenance costs. In response to these issues, we propose a construction method of the DT for the shop floor based on model-based systems engineering from the perspective of the system. In this method, a comprehensive DT model for the shop floor is gradually constructed by using system modeling language, the modeling method “MagicGrid,” and the “V model” of systems engineering. The model includes four dimensions of the shop-floor requirements, structure, behavior, and parameters, as well as three stages (the problem domain, solution domain, and implementation domain), and connects nine steps of the “V model,” including the system requirements, system architecture, subsystem implementation, subsystem integration, and system verification. Then, based on an example of a real NC machining shop floor, subsystems including a visualization system, synchronization system, and simulation system, are discussed. Finally, the functions of the integrated systems are verified based on the requirements, including the real-time synchronization of “man, machine, material, and method” and the transient simulation in real time. The numerical indicators of the integrated system are verified, including the model completeness and synchronization timeliness.",Cyber-physical production system | Digital twin | MagicGrid | Model-based systems engineering | Shop-floor digital twin | System modeling language,Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2021-07-01,Article,"Liu, Juan;Liu, Jianhua;Zhuang, Cunbo;Liu, Ziwen;Miao, Tian",Include,

The capabilities of industrial robots can be encapsulated as cloud services and used for ubiquitous manufacturing. Currently, the digital models for process simulation, path simulation, etc. are encapsulated as cloud services. The digital models in the cloud may not reflect the real state of the physical robotic manufacturing systems due to inaccurate or delayed condition update and therefore result in inaccurate simulation and robotic control. Digital twin can be used to realize fine sensing control of the physical manufacturing systems by a combination of high-fidelity digital model and sensory data. In this paper, we propose a framework of digital twin-based industrial cloud robotics (DTICR) for industrial robotic control and its key methodologies. The DTICR is divided into physical IR, digital IR, robotic control services, and digital twin data. First, the robotic control capabilities are encapsulated as Robot Control as-a-Service (RCaaS) based on manufacturing features and feature-level robotic capability model. Then the available RCaaSs are ranked and parsed. After manufacturing process simulation with digital IR models, RCaaSs are mapped to physical robots for robotic control. The digital IR models are connected to the physical robots and updated by sensory data. A case is implemented to demonstrate the workflow of DTICR. The results show that DTICR is capable to synchronize and merge digital IRs and physical IRs effectively.

The assembly process for these complex products involves high complexity, strong dynamics, many uncertainties, and frequent rework and repair, especially in the model development stage. Achieving assembly data management and process traceability for complex products has always been a challenge. A recently proposed solution involves one-to-one mapping of the corresponding physical entity, also known as the digital twin method. This paper proposes a digital twin-based assembly data management and process traceability approach for complex products. First, the dynamic evolutionary process of complex product assembly data was analyzed from three dimensions: granularity, period and version. Then, a framework of digital twin-based assembly data management and process traceability for complex products was constructed. Some core techniques are: 1) workflow-based product assembly data organization and version management; 2) synchronous modeling of the product assembly process based on digital twin; and 3) hierarchical management and traceability of product assembly data based on digital twin. On this basis, an algorithm flowchart for generating a product assembly data package was created, which includes product assembly data management, assembly process traceability, and generation of a product assembly data package. Furthermore, the Digital Twin-based Assembly Process Management and Control System (DT-APMCS) was designed to verify the efficiency of the proposed approach.

The emergence of CPS, digital twin, cloud computing, big data and other new technologies based on the industrial Internet enables information acquisition and pure reactive scheduling more practical to some extent. However, how to build a new architecture to solve the problems which traditional dynamic scheduling methods cannot solve becomes a new research challenge. Therefore, this paper designs a new bi-level distributed dynamic workshop scheduling architecture, which is based on the workshop digital twin scheduling agent and multiple service unit digital twin scheduling agents. Within this architecture, scheduling a physical workshop is decomposed to the whole workshop scheduling in the first level and its service unit scheduling in the second level. On the first level, the whole workshop scheduling is executed by its virtual workshop coordination (scheduling) agent embedded with the workshop digital twin consisting of multi-service unit digital twins. On the second level, each service unit scheduling coordinated by the first level scheduling is executed in a distributed way by the corresponding service unit scheduling agent associated with its service unit digital twin. The benefits of the new architecture include (1) if a dynamic scheduling only requires a single service unit scheduling, it will then be performed in the corresponding service unit scheduling without involving other service units, which will make the scheduling locally, simply and robustly. (2) when a dynamic scheduling requires changes in multiple service units in a coordinated way, the first level scheduling will be executed and then coordinate the second level service unit scheduling accordingly. This divide-and-then-conquer strategy will make the scheduling easier and practical.

A serial procedure is followed starting from the system's physical description, continuing to the dynamic analysis of independent models, and concluding with an experimental validation. The biped's mechanical model is tailored to preserve passive walker key functionalities without sacrificing design simplicity. The mechanical model gives rise to a mathematical model that describes the biped's gait, and to a multibody dynamics model of the biped. A passive biped robot prototype is developed based on the model. The prototype is equipped with a wireless sensor measuring system to enable data acquisition. The highlight of this work is the high degree of coincidence achieved between the passive response of the numerically simulated mathematical model, the response obtained by a multibody dynamics simulation, and the experimentally obtained response of the physical passive walking robot.

However, as radiation levels increase, so too will the number of maintenance tasks that must be performed without human access. To meet these conflicting constraints, remote maintenance systems must therefore significantly increase their capabilities, performing tasks faster and in parallel. Unfortunately, the current teleoperation-based maintenance approach is inherently limited in these regards. Automation emerges as a potential solution, having demonstrated dramatic productivity gains in manufacturing across the world. The European DEMO project has begun to explore the feasibility of automated maintenance as a route to meeting the challenging availability targets. To this end, the Automated Inspection and Maintenance Test Unit (AIM-TU) has been designed and constructed, providing a highly versatile test platform able to adapt to evolving R&D programmes. It consists of a modular robot cell equipped with two robot arms mounted on linear rails, interchangeable end-of-arm-tooling, a variety of vision sensors and a fully integrated safety system. The hardware is supported by a modular software architecture, which permits different control input modes and provides a digital twin simulation of the cell for virtual verification and validation of control algorithms.

However, several challenges including excessively long waiting time and a serious waste of energy still exist on the shop-floor where limited buffer exists for each machine (e.g., shop-floor that manufactures large-size products). The production logistics tasks are released after work-in-processes (WIPs) are processed, and the machines will be occupied before trolleys arrival when using passive material handling strategy. To address this issue, a proactive material handling method for CPS enabled shop-floor (CPS-PMH) is proposed. Firstly, the manufacturing resources (machines and trolleys) are made smart by applying CPS technologies so that they are able to sense, act, interact and behave within a smart environment. Secondly, a shop-floor digital twin model is created, aiming to reflect their status just like real-life objects, and key production performance indicators can be analysed timely. Then, a time-weighted multiple linear regression method (TWMLR) is proposed to forecast the remaining processing time of WIPs. A proactive material handling model is designed to allocate smart trolleys optimally. Finally, a case study from Southern China is used to validate the proposed method and results show that the proposed CPS-PMH can largely reduce the total non-value-added energy consumption of manufacturing resources and optimize the routes of smart trolleys.",Cyber physical system (CPS) | Large-size product | Material handling | Prediction model | Remaining processing time | Shop-floor,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2020-02-01,Article,"Wang, W.;Zhang, Yingfeng;Zhong, R.

This work proposes a data-driven approach to utilize digital transformation methods to automate smart manufacturing systems. This is fundamentally enabled by using a digital twin to represent manufacturing cells, simulate system behaviors, predict process faults, and adaptively control manipulated variables. First, the manufacturing cell is accommodated to environments such as computer-aided applications, industrial Product Lifecycle Management solutions, and control platforms for automation systems. Second, a network of interfaces between the environments is designed and implemented to enable communication between the digital world and physical manufacturing plant, so that near-synchronous controls can be achieved. Third, capabilities of some members in the family of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) are discussed with manufacturing features within the context of Smart Manufacturing. Trained results for Deep Q Learning algorithms are finally presented in this work as a case study to incorporate DRL-based artificial intelligence to the industrial control process. As a result, developed control methodology, named Digital Engine, is expected to acquire process knowledges, schedule manufacturing tasks, identify optimal actions, and demonstrate control robustness. The authors show that integrating a smart agent into the industrial platforms further expands the usage of the system-level digital twin, where intelligent control algorithms are trained and verified upfront before deployed to the physical world for implementation. Moreover, DRL approach to automated manufacturing control problems under facile optimization environments will be a novel combination between data science and manufacturing industries.",Artificial intelligence | Digital transformation | Robotics | Smart manufacturing systems | Virtual commissioning,Journal of Manufacturing Systems,2021-01-01,Article,"Xia, Kaishu;Sacco, Christopher;Kirkpatrick, Max;Saidy, Clint;Nguyen, Lam;Kircaliali, Anil;Harik, Ramy",Include,

In such context, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) play a key role in digitizing manufacturing systems and integrating multiple systems together for collaborative works. Amongst different levels of smartness and connectedness of CPS, Digital Twin (DT), as an exact digital copy of a physical object or system including its properties and relationship with the environment, has a significant impact on realizing smart manufacturing. A DT constantly synchronizes with its physical system and provides real-time high-fidelity simulations of the system and offers ubiquitous control over the system. Despite its great advantages, few works have been discussed about DT reference models, let alone a generic manner to establish it for smart manufacturing. Aiming to fill the gap, this research introduces a generic CPS system architecture for DT establishment in smart manufacturing with a novel tri-model-based approach (i.e. digital model, computational model and graph-based model) for product-level DT development. The tri-model works concurrently to simulate real-world physical behaviour and characteristics of the digital model. To validate the proposed architecture and approach, a case study of an open source 3D printer DT establishment is further conducted.

Given the importance of maintaining a transmission system's precision, this paper presents a hybrid approach framework driven by digital twin technology (DT), to predict performance degradation. Firstly, a DT model based on meta-action theory is established, and real-time monitoring and digital simulation, driven by DT data, is realized in order to analyze the precision of the transmission units in machine tools. Secondly, the wear of gear in transmission unit is studied through Achard wear theory, which considered the comprehensive influence of gear load and speed on surface wear of the gear pair tooth, based on the model driving method. The performance degradation of the transmission unit is obtained by using the RBF neural network algorithm based on the data-driven method to extrapolate the wear data to the field-measurable precision index value. In addition, the hybrid predictive approach of the performance degradation model through the particle filter algorithm is built, and the real-time data is used to update the current state estimation to improve the prediction accuracy. By combining the mechanism of the physical degradation processes with the real-time and historical data and turning them into a cooperative architecture, this prediction method uses the complementary advantages offered by the fusion of these methods to bridge the link between data-driven prediction and model-based prediction. Finally, the method has been successfully applied to the precision prediction of the transmission unit in CNCMT turntable, and it is compared with the single prediction method to verify the effectiveness and feasibility.",CNCMT | Data-driven | Digital twin | Performance degradation | Simulation | Wear,Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing,2022-02-01,Article,"Yang, Xin;Ran, Yan;Zhang, Genbao;Wang, Hongwei;Mu, Zongyi;Zhi, Shengguang",Include,

Alongside efforts to offer optimum solutions through plant design and sizing, it is also necessary to develop a flexible virtualised replica of renewable hydrogen plants, that not only models compatibility with the “plug-and-play” nature of many facilities, but that also identifies key elements for optimisation of system operation. This study presents a model for a renewable hydrogen production plant based on real-time historical and present-day datasets of PV connected to a virtualised grid-connected AC microgrid comprising different technologies of batteries, electrolysers, and fuel cells. Mathematical models for each technology were developed from chemical and physical metrics of the plant. The virtualised replica is the first step toward the implementation of a digital twin of the system, and accurate validation of the system behaviour when updated with real-time data. As a case study, a solar hydrogen pilot plant consisting of a 60 kW Solar PV, a 40 kW PEM electrolyser, a 15 kW LIB battery and a 5 kW PEM fuel cell were simulated and analysed. Two effective operational factors on the plant's performance are defined: (i) electrolyser power settings to determine appropriate hydrogen production over twilight periods and/or overnight and (ii) a user-defined minimum threshold for battery state of charge to prevent charge depletion overnight if the electrolyser load is higher than its capacity. The objective of this modelling is to maximise hydrogen yield while both loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and microgrid excess power are minimised. This analysis determined: (i) a hydrogen yield of 38–39% from solar DC energy to hydrogen energy produced, (ii) an LPSP <2.6 × 10−4 and (iii) < 2% renewable energy lost to the grid as excess electricity for the case study.",Analytical model | Operational aspect | Renewable hydrogen | Replica simulation,International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,2022-01-05,Article,"Mohammadshahi, Shahrzad S.;Boulaire, Fanny A.;Love, Jonathan;Gorji, Saman A.;Mackinnon, Ian D.R.",Exclude,

An accurate 3D model of a city can be published online and walked around by the public to view proposed changes in urban planning and policy. This allows for easier dissemination and transparency to the public before putting these decisions into practice. This open and public model allows for an additional virtual feedback loop where citizens can interact and report feedback on planned changes in the city. Citizens can also interact with components to tag and report problems in their area. The digital twin also allows for additional experimentation where 3D data is necessary, such as flood evacuation planning.

Equipping Digital Twins with artificial intelligence functionalities can greatly expand those beneficial applications or open up altogether new areas of application, among them cross-phase industrial transfer learning. In the context of machine learning, transfer learning represents a set of approaches that enhance learning new tasks based upon previously acquired knowledge. Here, knowledge is transferred from one lifecycle phase to another in order to reduce the amount of data or time needed to train a machine learning algorithm. Looking at common challenges in developing and deploying industrial machinery with deep learning functionalities, embracing this concept would offer several advantages: Using an intelligent Digital Twin, learning algorithms can be designed, configured and tested in the design phase before the physical system exists and real data can be collected. Once real data becomes available, the algorithms must merely be fine-tuned, significantly speeding up commissioning and reducing the probability of costly modifications. Furthermore, using the Digital Twin's simulation capabilities virtually injecting rare faults in order to train an algorithm's response or using reinforcement learning, e.g. to teach a robot, become practically feasible.

This phenomenon is clearly observable in the manufacturing sector, where, due to the diffusion of Industry 4.0 paradigm, physical processes are integrating effectively with digital ones. One recent innovative technology is the Digital Twin (DT), where digital models and physical ones communicate – by sharing data as well as information – usually in a bidirectional way. As recent studies have analyzed the current level of adoption of DT technologies in the manufacturing sector, less effort has been focused on evaluating applications in the safety domain. Theoretically, the DT inherent capability of acquiring data from the physical world - usually developed in real time – together with the potentiality of reliable data processing could support a more effective diffusion of dynamic risk assessment models as well as real time alert management systems for improving safety. Otherwise, the actual capability of real applications highly depends on the level of complexity of the specific DT. The aim of the study is to provide a methodology to assess current application of DT technologies; the framework has been developed in the safety domain aiming to point out to researchers as well as technicians in a clear way the capabilities of a specific DT application. The framework has been adopted for analyzing current applications of DT in the scientific literature aiming to propose a theoretical validation. The application has outlined that, although the number of DT applications in the safety field is not so large, the current tools developed are characterized by a high level of complexity thus providing higher reliability to support the specific safety problem in analysis.

Dynamic systems are well understood across engineering and science domains, and represent a familiar and convenient platform for exploring the various aspects of a digital twin design. The aim is to create a framework accessible to engineering sciences related to the aerospace, electrical, mechanical and computational area. The virtual model of the physical system is expressed as a differential equation in two-time scales, with the concept of a slow time being used to separate the evolution of the system properties from the instantaneous time. Cases involving stiffness variation and mass variation are considered, individually and together. It is assumed that the damped natural frequency and the time response are measured through sensors placed on the physical system. Issues of errors and reduced sampling rate in sensor measurements on the digital twin are investigated. The digital twin is expressed as an analytical solution through closed-form expressions and the effect of sensor errors is brought out through the simulations. Several key concepts introduced in this paper are summarized and ideas for urgent future research needs are proposed.

Automotive manufacturers are keen to develop e-machine manufacturing and assembly knowledge in-house. An on-going project, which aims to deliver an e-machine pilot assembly line, is being supported by a set of virtual engineering tools developed by the Automation Systems Group at the University of Warwick. Although digital models are a useful design aid providing visualization and simulation, the opportunity being exploited in this research paper is to have a common model throughout the lifecycle of both the manufacturing system and the product. The vision is to have a digital twin that is consistent with the real system and not just used in the early design and deployment phases. This concept, commonly referred to as Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), is key to realizing efficient system reconfigurability to support alternative product volumes and mixes. These tools produce modular digital models that can be rapidly modified preventing the simulation, test, and modification processes forming a bottleneck to the development lifecycles. In addition, they add value at more mature phases when, for example, a high volume line based on the pilot is created as the same models can be reused and modified as required. This research paper therefore demonstrates how the application of the virtual engineering tools support the development of a CPS using an e-machine assembly station as a case study.

At the same time, knowledge gleamed from extended periods of execution can be exploited to reduce the uncertainties that were inevitably presented in the system models that are used to define the temporal behaviours of the control tasks. In this paper we utilise this knowledge and present an adaptation method that actively extends the period of control tasks at run-time based on historical measurements. This can lead to lower power consumption or to the accommodation of increased computation resource demands from other components of the CPS.

Published by Elsevier B.V.Modern technologies, such as cyber-physical systems and the digital twin, are driving current developments in digital production and its virtual planning tools. Thus leads to specific need for consistent methods that can be used across projects, especially on the future production planning’s long term view. Existing approaches deal with the cross-sectoral, virtually supported integration of cyber-physical properties in production structures by using multiple software structures. However, the potential of current production-related simulation tools in the field of systems virtual validation in the planning phase has not yet been exhausted. Based on this, the present work deals with a method for model data enrichment within virtual model-based systems development process that is executed in front of systems’ virtual commissioning. The elaborated method presupposes the successful procurement of the necessary CAD data as geometrical information and is divided into four steps, starting from the analysis of the process parameters on the basis of the product to be produced. In the second step, a property determination of the existing and planned production structure is carried out. In order to transfer the findings to the virtual modeling process, the third step is to determine the modeling needs between the current state of production and the planned cyber-physical production. Finally, a data enrichment of the products and resources behavioral models takes place that causes possibility of the mutual production-technical influence for example, by synchronizing the process structure that is stored in virtual products and resources. The method is to be classified as a total consideration of products, processes and resources in simulation-based functional verification and physical property validation. In addition, the four steps will be verified, by using the automated car-underbody assembly demonstrator for the physical relief of workers in the final assembly area of automobile production, including many variants.",Cyber-physical systems (CPS) | Digital tools | Simulation-based design method | Virtual comissioning (VC),Procedia CIRP,2019-01-01,Conference Paper,"Illmer, Benjamin;Vielhaber, Michael",Exclude,

The analysis of the existing diagnostic methods for active safety systems in operation shows that on-board diagnostics of active safety systems does not cover the entire list of possible malfunctions. It is also worth considering that the electric drive systems of active safety systems are an integral part of the vehicle's braking system influencing traffic safety during operation. This issue can be resolved by supplementing the monitoring process with an additional diagnostics complex. This monitoring system receives data on the working processes of the vehicle automated systems' components in real time. An important difference from existing diagnostic systems is the ability to determine the exact malfunction of a vehicle's automated system component, as well as to establish the cause of the malfunction, allowing the system to reduce the possibility of a recurring malfunction and improve traffic safety. Coupled together with a data-sharing interface, this monitoring system enables the creation of the active vehicle's digital twin. We provide an example of how this simulation technology, based on a fusion of virtual and physical elements, helps study vehicle performance in complex, multi-factor operation modes. This diagnostic system, used in combination with a bench chassis model, makes it possible to adapt the system if the manufacturer adjusts the vehicle's automated system design, thereby simplifying the process of further verification of the digital twin.

All rights reserved.Products are increasingly individualized and enhanced to be able to communicate, e.g. via Industrial Internet of Things (IoT). However, the impact of products on sustainability (environmental and social) across their life is often not considered and analyzed. IoT-based or smart products, that are able to communicate, generate data, which can be used to monitor and optimize sustainability indicators. The Digital Twin (DT) is a new technological concept which focuses on product individual data collection and analysis. It provides the possibility to make use of the available data and optimize the systems individual sustainability as well as future product generations. However, the design and realization of such a DT requires new approaches and capabilities, which is an identified research gap. Therefore, this paper presents a methodology to develop DTs of physical IoT-based products, the so called DT V-Model with the aim to optimize the systems sustainability, specifically environmental aspects. It is based on the V-model for the development of smart products and is enhanced with additional roles and approaches for DT development. The methodology is described in detail. The result of a development cycle according to the DT-V-Model is a tested concept of a DT, which includes Digital Master (DM) data from the planning phase and Digital Shadow (DS) data from the production, operation and End of Life-phase. For a DT for energy efficiency, the Digital Master model consists of the information and models from the product development phase including the planned production and use phase energy consumption. The Digital Shadow consists of the actual production energy consumption and the use phase energy consumption. The methodology is applied to a use case of an IoT-based consumer product that can be customized to a certain degree by the consumer. A DT is developed to monitor and optimize the products energy efficiency in production and use. The necessary elements of the DT and the capabilities are depicted.

However, most of the claimed DT in literature are only replicating the real system in a synchronized fashion, without feeding back actions on the control system of the equipment.

The challenge of realizing these advanced manufacturing environments with integrated Exoskeletons is represented by missing design and planning methods required to equip future workplaces with this enabling technology. The integration of Exoskeletons in logistics and production activities creates a new hybrid type of workstation that has to be designed according to a scientific approach. The article presents the first steps in developing an innovative approach to planning and optimizing intelligent working environments with integrated adaptive Exoskeletons.

The proposed method, termed DORI, combines operational modal analysis (OMA), FE modeling, rapid surrogate modeling (SM) and non-linear Incremental dynamic analysis (IDA). While OMA-based Structural Health Monitoring methods using statistical pattern recognition are known to allow the detection of small structural damages due to earthquakes, even far-field ones of moderate intensity, the combination of SM and IDA-based methods for damage localization and quantification is here proposed. The monumental bell tower of the Basilica of San Pietro located in Perugia, Italy, is considered for the validation of the method. While being continuously monitored since 2014, the bell tower experienced the main shocks of the 2016 Central Italy seismic sequence and the on-site vibration-based monitoring system detected changes in global dynamic behavior after the earthquakes. In the paper, experimental vibration data (continuous and seismic records), FE models and surrogate models of the structure are used for post-earthquake damage localization and quantification exploiting an ideal subdivision of the structure into meaningful macroelements. Results of linear and non-linear numerical modeling (SM and IDA, respectively) are successfully combined to this aim and the continuous exchange of information between the physical reality (monitoring data) and the virtual models (FE models and surrogate models) effectively enforces the Digital Twin paradigm.

Digital twin is an ingenious concept that helps on organizing different areas of expertise aiming at supporting engineering decisions related to a specific asset; it articulates computational models, sensors, learning, real time analysis, diagnosis, prognosis, and so on. In this framework, and to leverage its capacity, we explore the integration of physics-based models with machine learning. A digital twin is constructed for a damaged structure, where a discrete physics-based computational model is employed to investigate several damage scenarios. A machine learning classifier, that serves as the digital twin, is trained with data taken from a stochastic computational model. This strategy allows the use of an interpretable model (physics-based) to build a fast digital twin (machine learning) that will be connected to the physical twin to support real time engineering decisions. Different classifiers (quadratic discriminant, support vector machines, etc) are tested, and different model parameters (number of sensors, level of noise, damage intensity, uncertainty, operational parameters, etc) are considered to construct datasets for the training. The accuracy of the digital twin depends on the scenario analyzed. Through the chosen application, we are able to emphasize each step of a digital twin construction, including the possibility of integrating physics-based models with machine learning.

Most implementations are online methods that use visual or force feedback of the demonstrator. However, we developed an offline programming approach for PbD with a special input device within an Augmented Reality Environment. Therefore, this paper aims to answer how the characteristics and functionality of the end effector of a jointed-arm robot can be represented by a haptic input device in order to perform PbD. The PbD process is first carried out on a digital twin of the robot, visualized to the user in real physical space by means of augmented reality technology. The programming of the digital twin can later be transferred to the real robot. The haptic input device in this context is the main part of the Cyber-Physical-System (CPS), which enables the user to interact with the virtual robot. Therefore, the specification of the mechanical and software components of the CPS is of main importance. Within this paper, strategies for the implementation of shape and function abstraction, as well as for ensuring communication, have been worked out. The physical shape of the CPS is kept generic and is only subject to ergonomic restrictions. However, Augmented Reality overlays the physical shape with an exact digital image of the end effector used later in the process. Nevertheless, the physical characteristics of the real robot should be represented as real as possible by the CPS. Therefore, the CPS is equipped with various sensors and actuators. With the CPS it is possible to determine contact forces and to manipulate objects to a certain extent in order to teach gripping strategies to the digital twin. An operating system was developed for communication and control of the electronic components. For the validation of the functionality of the CPS an exemplary PbD process was developed, the results were analyzed and evaluated.","augmented reality | cyber physical system | industrial robot | programming by demonstration, digital twin",Procedia CIRP,2021-01-01,Conference Paper,"Müller, Fabian;Deuerlein, Christian;Koch, Michael",Exclude,

Digital models can perform good in terms of production planning and control decisions if they are correctly representing their physical counterparts at anytime. Discrete event simulation can be considered as established digital models of manufacturing system, thanks to the proven capabilities of correctly estimating the system performances. Automated simulation model generation techniques can significantly reduce model development phases and allow for using simulation models for short term decisions in production. Application studies and test cases are scarce in the literature. In this paper, we present the application of a digital model generation method. The test case is done exploiting a lab-scale model of a manufacturing system composed by six stations.

Published by Elsevier B.V.Part distortion during additive manufacturing (AM) may lead to catastrophic failure and significant waste of resources. Existing work often focuses on identification and detection of individual root causes such as melt pool geometries or extruder clogging to prevent part failures. Since the end-effect of major print failures can be the result of multiple error sources (including unknowns), relying on detection of individual root causes may misclassify some failed prints as successful. Instead, detecting end-effects or part distortion could provide early warning of major failures regardless of potential error sources. Distortion detection, however, currently involves computationally expensive simulation and analysis of sensing data. One promising solution is to adopt digital twin strategy to quickly compare model prediction to features extracted from in situ sensing data. This study extends the digital twin strategy to major distortion detection by developing (1) a multi-view optical sensing system for movable print beds and (2) failure detection methods by analyzing multi-view of part images layer by layer. Since the digital twin of actual prints at specific layers are generated offline, delay can be reduced to determine if a significant enough quality departure has occurred to justify termination of the print. In the experimental evaluation of this approach for a FDM machine with a moving print bed, failure was rapidly detected in two of the three test prints, while in the remaining print, failure was successfully detected after a short delay.",Cyber-physical system | Failure detection | In situ optical sensing | Multi-view | Shape deformation,Procedia Manufacturing,2021-01-01,Conference Paper,"Henson, Christopher M.;Decker, Nathan I.;Huang, Qiang",Include,

Meanwhile, software-components are increasingly becoming an essential part of the inspection process because of increasing part complexities in design and the high-volume of data captured from different sensors in hardware-components. This paper presents a virtual replica to work parallel to an integrated inspection system (IIS) for inspection of freeform and complex surfaces based on a metric of their geometric complexity. In this approach, an intelligently guided sampling is virtually conducted from a large dataset, instead of the physical sampling process when the sample points are traditionally selected randomly from the measured surface. Implementation of a closed-loop between the main tasks in IIS is considered in developing this digital twin to reduce the uncertainties associated with the inspection process. A method is introduced to estimate the local densities of the measured points required for virtual sampling from each patch on the work-pieces's surface based on its geometric complexity. Two case studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the methodology. The observed efficiency in selection of the important measured data in the proposed sampling strategy makes it a better sampling strategy to be implemented in a digital twin for IISs.",Coordinate Metrology | Deviation Zone Estimation | Digital Manufacturing | Digital Twin | geometric complexity | Integrated inspection system | Point Measurement Planning | Substitute Geometry Evaluation | Virtual Sampling,IFAC-PapersOnLine,2019-01-01,Conference Paper,"Gohari, Hossein;Berry, Cody;Barari, Ahmad",Include,

As it is known, poor accuracy which is most influenced by the stiffness of robot structure is recognized as a limiting factor for successful use of robots in milling tasks. Since there are different sources of error in robots, virtual manufacturing systems provide a useful means for products to be manufactured without the need of physical testing on the shop floor. This paper presents the developed virtual robot machining model, as a part of digital twin, for the simulation of a modified tool path generated by the compensation algorithm for the errors induced by cutting forces due to robot compliance.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Friction stir welding (FSW) is an innovative solid-state welding technology that produces high quality joints and is widely used in the aerospace industry. Previous studies have revealed welding temperature to be a decisive factor for joint quality. Consequently, several temperature control systems for FSW have been developed. These output feedback control systems usually require delicate and expensive temperature measuring equipment, which reduces their suitability for industrial practice. This paper presents a novel state feedback system of the welding temperature to remedy this shortcoming. The system uses a physical model of the FSW process (digital twin) for the determination of the welding temperature signal from the process torque signal. The digital twin is based on a multi-input nonlinear time invariant model, which is fed with the torque signal from the spindle motor. A model-based L1 adaptive controller was employed for its robustness with respect to model inaccuracies and fast adaption to fluctuations in the controlled system. The experimental validation of the feedback control system showed improved weld quality compared to welded joints produced without temperature control. The achieved control accuracies depended on the results of the temperature calculation. Control deviations of less than 10 K could be achieved for certain welding parameters, and even for a work piece geometry, which deliberately caused heat accumulation.",Digital twin | Friction stir welding | L  adaptive control 1 | Robotic friction stir welding | Soft sensor | Temperature feedback control | Temperature measurement,Metals,2020-07-01,Article,"Sigl, Martina E.;Bachmann, Andreas;Mair, Thomas;Zaeh, Michael F.",Include,

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Hyperconnectivity via modern Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has recently driven us to envision “digital twin”, in which physical attributes are all embedded, and their latest updates are synchronized on digital spaces in a timely fashion. From the point of view of cyberphysical system (CPS) architectures, the goals of digital twin include providing common programming abstraction on the same level of databases, thereby facilitating seamless integration of real-world physical objects and digital assets at several different system layers. However, the inherent limitations of sampling and observing physical attributes often pose issues related to data uncertainty in practice. In this paper, we propose a learning-based data management scheme where the implementation is layered between sensors attached to physical attributes and domain-specific applications, thereby mitigating the data uncertainty between them. To do so, we present a sensor data management framework, namely D2WIN, which adopts reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to manage the data quality for CPS applications and autonomous systems. To deal with the scale issue incurred by many physical attributes and sensor streams when adopting RL, we propose an action embedding strategy that exploits their distance-based similarity in the physical space coordination. We introduce two embedding methods, i.e., a user-defined function and a generative model, for different conditions. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the D2WIN framework with the action embedding outperforms several known heuristics in terms of achievable data quality under certain resource restrictions. We also test the framework with an autonomous driving simulator, clearly showing its benefit. For example, with only 30% of updates selectively applied by the learned policy, the driving agent maintains its performance about 96.2%, as compared to the ideal condition with full updates.",Action embedding | Autonomous system | Digital twin | Real-time data | Reinforcement learning | Sensor network,Sensors (Switzerland),2019-10-02,Article,"Jeong, Seunghwan;Yoo, Gwangpyo;Yoo, Minjong;Yeom, Ikjun;Woo, Honguk",Exclude,

The primary goal of such virtual prototypes is to predict the light output characteristics of LED luminaires under different operating conditions. The key component in such digital twins of a luminaire is an appropriate multi-domain model for packaged LED devices that captures the electrical, thermal, and light output characteristics and their mutual dependence simultaneously and consistently. We developed two such models with this goal in mind that are presented in detail in this paper. The first model is a semi analytical, quasi black-box model that can be implemented on the basis of the built-in diode models of spice-like circuit simulators and a few added controlled sources. Our second presented model is derived from the physics of the operation of today's power LEDs realized with multiple quantum well heterojunction structures. Both models have been implemented in the form of visual basic macros as well as circuit models suitable for usual spice circuit simulators. The primary test bench for the two circuit models was an LTspice simulation environment. Then, to support the design of different demonstrator luminaires of the Delphi4LED project, a spreadsheet application was developed, which ensured seamless integration of the two models with additional models representing the LED chips' thermal environment in a luminaire.

In the past, virtual coordinate measuring machines have been extensively researched. Research on digital twins of optical systems is still lacking due to the high number of error contributors. A method to describe a digital twin of an optical measurement system is presented in this article. The discussed optical system is a laser line scanner mounted on a coordinate measuring machine. Each component of the measurement system is mathematically described. The coordinate measuring machine focuses on the hardware errors and the laser line scanner determines the measurement error based on the scan depth, in‐plane angle and out‐of‐plane angle. The digital twin assumes stable measurement conditions and uniform surface characteristics. Based on the Monte Carlo principle, virtual measurements can be used to determine the measurement uncertainty. This is demonstrated by validating the digital twin on a set of calibrated ring gauges. Two validation tests are performed: the first verifies the virtual uncertainty estimation by comparison with experimental data.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.In smart manufacturing, human-cyber-physical systems host digital twins and IoT-based net-works. The networks weave manufacturing enablers such as CNC machine tools, robots, CAD/CAM systems, process planning systems, enterprise resource planning systems, and human resources. The twins work as the brains of the enablers; that is, the twins supply the required knowledge and help enablers solve problems autonomously in real-time. Since surface roughness is a major concern of all manufacturing processes, twins to solve surface roughness-relevant problems are needed. The twins must machine-learn the required knowledge from the relevant datasets available in big data. Therefore, preparing surface roughness-relevant datasets to be included in the human-cyber-physical system-friendly big data is a critical issue. However, preparing such datasets is a challenge due to the lack of a steadfast procedure. This study sheds some light on this issue. A state-of-the-art method is proposed to prepare the said datasets for surface roughness, wherein each dataset consists of four segments: semantic annotation, roughness model, simulation algorithm, and simulation system. These segments provide input information for digital twins’ input, modeling, simulation, and validation modules. The semantic annotation segment boils down to a concept map. A human-and machine-readable concept map is thus developed where the information of other segments (roughness model, simulation algorithm, and simulation system) is integrated. The delay map of surface roughness profile heights plays a pivotal role in the proposed dataset preparation method. The successful preparation of datasets of surface roughness underlying milling, turning, grinding, electric discharge machining, and polishing shows the efficacy of the proposed method.

A simple flexible robotic arm is considered as a benchmark problem for the evaluation of various techniques used in the phases of modelling, analysis, control system design, validation, and implementation. The flexible nature of the mechanical structure introduces inherently oscillatory dynamics in the target bandwidth range, which complicates all the above-mentioned design steps. This paper demonstrates the process of deriving a complex nonlinear model of the flexible arm setup. An initial idea about the plant dynamics is acquired from analytical modelling using the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory. A more thorough understanding is subsequently acquired from finite element analysis. Linearisation and order reduction are the next steps necessary for the derivation of a simplified control-relevant model. A time-dependent variable parameter of load mass position is considered and a robust controller is subsequently designed in order to fulfil certain performance criteria for all the admissible plant configurations. This is performed using a recent H-infinity loop shaping method for fixed structure controller design.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).Industry 4.0 requires phenomenon twins to functionalize the relevant systems (e.g., cyber-physical systems). A phenomenon twin means a computable virtual abstraction of a real phenomenon. In order to systematize the construction process of a phenomenon twin, this study proposes a system defined as the phenomenon twin construction system. It consists of three components, namely the input, processing, and output components. Among these components, the processing component is the most critical one that digitally models, simulates, and validates a given phenomenon extracting information from the input component. What kind of modeling, simulation, and validation approaches should be used while constructing the processing component for a given phenomenon is a research question. This study answers this question using the case of surface roughness-a complex phenomenon associated with all material removal processes. Accordingly, this study shows that for modeling the surface roughness of a machined surface, the approach called semantic modeling is more effective than the conventional approach called the Markov chain. It is also found that to validate whether or not a simulated surface roughness resembles the expected roughness, the outcomes of the possibility distribution-based computing and DNA-based computing are more effective than the outcomes of a conventional computing wherein the arithmetic mean height of surface roughness is calculated. Thus, apart from the conventional computing approaches, the leading edge computational intelligence-based approaches can digitize manufacturing processes more effectively.",Complex phenomenon | Cyber-physical systems | Digital twin | DNA-based computing | Industry 4.0 | Markov chain | Monte Carlo simulation | Semantic modeling | Surface roughness,Journal of Manufacturing and Materials Processing,2020-03-01,Article,"Ghosh, Angkush Kumar;Sharif Ullah, A.

Traditional expert knowledgebased Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) processes can be smartened up with the assistance of various AI techniques, such as deep learning models. On the other hand, current deep learning based prognostics suffers from the data deficit issue, especially considering the varying operating conditions and the degradation modes of the components in practical industrial applications. With the development of simulation techniques, physical-knowledge based digital twin models give engineers access to a large amount of simulation data at a lower cost. These simulation data contain the physical characteristics and the degradation information of the component. In order to accurately predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) during the degradation process, in this paper, a bearing digital twin model is constructed based on a phenomenological vibration model. A Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) is used to achieve the domain adaptation target between the simulation and the real data. Regarding the simulation data as the source domain and the real data as the target domain, the DANN model is able to predict the RUL without any priori knowledge of the labelling information.

In order to achieve optimal energy management of solar cars, it is necessary to comprehensively characterize the energy flow of vehicular components. To model these components which are hard to formulate, this study stim-ulates a solar car with the digital twin (DT) technology to accurately characterize energy. Based on the hybrid modeling approach combining mechanistic and data-driven technologies, the DT model of a solar car is established with a designed cloud platform server based on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to realize data interaction between physical and virtual entities. The DT model is further modified by the offline optimization data of drive motors, and the energy consumption is evaluated with the DT system in the real-world experiment. Specifically, the energy consumption error between the experiment and simulation is less than 5.17%, which suggests that the established DT model can accurately stimulate energy consumption.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.This paper deals with the design and implementation of a universal cyber-physical model capable of simulating any production process in order to optimize its logistics systems. The basic idea is the direct possibility of testing and debugging advanced logistics algorithms using a digital twin outside the production line. Since the digital twin requires a physical connection to a real line for its operation, this connection is substituted by a modular cyber-physical system (CPS), which replicates the same physical inputs and outputs as a real production line. Especially in fully functional production facilities, there is a trend towards optimizing logistics systems in order to increase efficiency and reduce idle time. Virtualization techniques in the form of a digital twin are standardly used for this purpose. The possibility of an initial test of the physical implementation of proposed optimization changes before they are fully implemented into operation is a pragmatic question that still resonates on the production side. Such concerns are justified because the proposed changes in the optimization of production logistics based on simulations from a digital twin tend to be initially costly and affect the existing functional production infrastructure. Therefore, we created a universal CPS based on requirements from our cooperating manufacturing companies. The model fully physically reproduces the real conditions of simulated production and verifies in advance the quality of proposed optimization changes virtually by the digital twin. Optimization costs are also significantly reduced, as it is not necessary to verify the optimization impact directly in production, but only in the physical model. To demonstrate the versatility of deployment, we chose a configuration simulating a robotic assembly workplace and its logistics.",Assembly lines | Color sensor | Cyber-physical model | Digital twin | Logistic control algorithms | Robotic workplace,Sensors,2021-03-01,Article,"Vachálek, Ján;Šišmišová, Dana;Vašek, Pavol;Fit’ka, Ivan;Slovák, Juraj;Šimovec, Matej",Include,

Although quite a few theoretical unified data models of BIM and GIS integration have been presented in precedent research, the practical web-based applications and software support for real-world city information modeling are still difficult to achieve. One of the challenges is storage inefficiency. It thence leads to burdens in exchange and analysis, which hugely impede the realization of virtual-real fusion. To address that issue, in this research, we contribute to exploring an HDF- (Hierarchical Data Format-) based, innovative, and synthesized scheme with three significant technical processes. First, data reorganization trims the original data with efficient redundancy elimination and reordering for IFC-SPF (IFC STEP Physical File) and XML-encoded CityGML (City Geography Markup Language). Next, bidirectional transformation methods for BIM and GIS modeling data, images, and analytical data into HDF are proposed. They retain the entities and relationships in modeling data and can further improve the compactness and accessibility by ultimately 60%-80% which saves 497,612 KB from 565,152 KB in the test of ZhongChun transformation substation. Finally, data aggregation enhances the bond of the integrated model and heterogeneous data resources from the transformed HDF files. The case studies show that the approach proposed in this paper could reach high efficiency for practicability of the BIM + GIS integration model.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).The design and development of composite structures requires precise and robust manufacturing processes. Composite materials such as fiber reinforced thermoplastics (FRTP) provide a good balance between manufacturing time, mechanical performance and weight. In this contribution, we investigate the process combination of thermoforming FRTP sheets (organo sheets) and injection overmolding of short FRTP for automotive structures. The limiting factor in those structures is the bond strength between the organo sheet and the overmolded thermoplastic. Within this process chain, even small deviations of the process settings (e.g., temperature) can lead to significant defects in the structure. A cyber physical production system based framework for a digital twin combining simulation and machine learning is presented. Based on parametric Finite-Element-Method (FEM) studies, training data for machine learning methods are generated and a FEM surrogate is developed. A comparison of different data-driven methods yields information on the estimation accuracy of task-specific data-driven methods. Finally, in accordance with experimental cross tension tests, the investigated FEM surrogate model is able to predict the interface bond strength quality in dependence of the process settings.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Optimising an existing production plant is a challenging task for companies. Necessary physical test runs disturb running production processes. Simulation models are one opportunity to limit these physical test runs. This is particularly important since today’s fast and intelligent networking opportunities in production systems are in line with the call of Industry 4.0 for substantial and frequent changes. Creating simulation models for those systems requires high effort and in-depth knowledge of production processes. In the current literature, digital twins promise several advantages for production optimisation and can be used to simulate production systems, which reduce necessary physical test runs and related costs. While most companies are not able to create digital twins yet, companies using enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have the general capability to create digital shadows. This paper presents a concept and a case study for a generic simulation of production systems in AnyLogic™ to create digital shadows as the first step towards a full digital twin. The generic simulation visualises production systems automatically and displays key performance indicators (KPIs) for the planned production program, using representational state transfer (REST) interfaces to extract product and production data from an ERP system.

Recent developments in Digital Twinning (DT) enable the online availability of operational data from the physical asset required for operational validation. The benefits of DT in situations where operational validation has formed a basis for model adaptation has also been demonstrated. However, these benefits within DT have not been fully utilized due to the lack of an approach for benchmarking the required quantity, quality and diversity of validation data and performance metrics for online model validation and adaptation. Therefore, there is a need for a framework for benchmarking validation data and metrics requirements during model validation in different domains. An approach for benchmarking the required quantity, quality and variability of validation data and performance metric(s) for online model adaptation within DT is proposed. The approach is focused on addressing the problem of parameter(s) uncertainty of a predictive model within its uncertainty boundary. It involves generating virtual test models, a primary and another reference model for the performance evaluation of one compared to the another with the benchmarked validating data and metrics within DT. This process is repeated until the dataset and/or metric(s) are promising enough to validate primary model against the reference model. The proposed approach is demonstrated using BEASY - a simulator designed to predict protection provided by a cathodic protection system to an asset. In this case, a marine structure is the focus of the study, where the protection potentials to prevent corrosion are predicted over the life of the structure. The algorithm(s) for the approach are provided within a Scientific Software (MATLAB) and integrated to the simulator-based cathodic-protection model.",Adaptive Simulation Validation | Cathodic-Protection Digital Twin | Validating Framework,International Journal of Computational Methods and Experimental Measurements,2021-01-01,Article,"Sapkota, Madhu Sudan;Apeh, Edward;Hadfield, Mark;Haratian, Roya;Adey, Robert;Baynham, John",Include,

All rights reserved.Additive technologies are promising for manufacturing parts of metal navigation devices with complex shapes. Finite element analysis is used during the designing of such items. The modeling accuracy is determined by the correctness of the specified physical properties of materials. The properties of materials used in 3D printing significantly differ from the ones used in the traditional manufacturing. Researchers focus on such characteristics as Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, hardness and strength. Meanwhile, some applications require dynamic properties. The paper presents the investigation and comparison of damping properties of three steel parts produced by different methods. The first part is manufactured by 3D printing with melting in the transverse direction, and the second part is done by melting in the longitudinal direction, while the third one is traditionally manufactured. The parts are shaft shaped with constant cross-section and have the same geometric dimensions. The TIRA TV 5220 / LS-120 stand is used. A piezoelectric accelerometer is installed at the loose end of the part. The tests are carried out in the frequency range from 15 to 3500 Hz and with an acceleration of 19.6 m/s2 (2 g). The accelerometer output is used to calculate the damping coefficient. The results are verified by comparison with the finite element modeling results. The damping coefficients of transverse and longitudinal 3D-printed parts are 0.022 and 0.006, respectively. The damping coefficient of the traditional manufactured part is 0.023. The difference of 3D-printed parts damping coefficients can be explained by the denser fusion of powder granules when printing one layer than between layers. In this case, a crystal structure with greater rigidity in the printing plane is formed and it limits the dissipation of vibrati on energy due to internal friction. Finite element modeling shows mismatch between the experimental and calculated values of the printed parts natural frequencies. Considering that the values of natural frequencies are largely determined by Young’s modulus, a parametric optimization of its value is carried out. It was found that the value of Young’s modulus does not correspond to the values determined during tensile tests for similar samples. Thus, 3D-printed parts have different vibration and static stiffness. This is not typical for metals and should be taken into account in simulations. The research results can be used in the simulation model development of steel 3D-printed parts and in the design of digital twins for navigation devices. It allows one to estimate vibration resistance of promising products at the early stages of their design and to optimize the construction minimizing stress.",Additive technologies | Damping coefficient | Digital twin | Finite element modeling | Simulation | Vibration exposure | Vibration stiffness,"Scientific and Technical Journal of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics",2021-05-01,Article,"Eliseev, Daniil P.;Konakov, Roman D.",Exclude,

Since CPSoS can be highly heterogeneous, we rather target the support for producing and maintaining a single integrated virtual representation of the CPSoS (i.e. a System of Twins) on which it is possible to perform global reasoning, analysis and verification. However, such a new paradigm comes with several open research challenges. We provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in key areas related to TDE.

Nikula et al., published by De Gruyter 2020.Digital twins have gained a lot of attention in modern day industry, but practical challenges arise from the requirement of continuous and real-time data integration. The actual physical systems are also exposed to disturbances unknown to the real-time simulation. Therefore, adaptation is required to ensure reliable performance and to improve the usability of digital twins in monitoring and diagnostics. This study proposes a general approach to the real-time adaptation of digital twins based on a mechanism guided by evolutionary optimization. The mechanism evaluates the deviation between the measured state of the real system and the estimated state provided by the model under adaptation. The deviation is minimized by adapting the model input based on the differential evolution algorithm. To test the mechanism, the measured data were generated via simulations based on a physical model of the real system. The estimated data were generated by a surrogate model, namely a simplified version of the physical model. A case study is presented where the adaptation mechanism is applied on the digital twin of a marine thruster. Satisfactory accuracy was achieved in the optimization during continuous adaptation. However, further research is required on the algorithms and hardware to reach the real-time computation requirement.",adaptation | differential evolution | digital twin | optimization | surrogate model,Open Engineering,2020-01-01,Article,"Nikula, Riku Pekka;Paavola, Marko;Ruusunen, Mika;Keski-Rahkonen, Joni",Exclude,

Therefore, the need for applying agile development practices in the model-based design of CPS is becoming more widespread. This is no easy feat, as CPS are inherently complex, and their model-based development is less suited for agile development. Model-based development does suit the concept of digital twin, that is, design models representing a system instance in operation. In this paper we present an approach where the digital twins of system instances serve as a common-knowledge base for the entire agile development cycle of the system when performing system updates. Doing so enables interesting possibilities, such as the identification and detection of system variants, which is beneficial for the verification and validation of the system update. It also brings along challenges, as the executable physics based digital twin is generally computationally expensive. In this paper we introduce this approach by means of a small example of a swiveling pick and place robotic arm.

It involves model calibration, model validation, and model refinement. Model calibration estimates the optimal value of unknown parameters. Model validation determines the validity of a computational model, and model refinement enhances a model to improve its accuracy. In model improvement, a variety of sources of errors in the observation and prediction can interrupt the model improvement process. The error sources degrade the parameter estimation accuracy in model calibration. When a computational model turns out to be invalid because of these error sources, model refinement is required. However, since model validation cannot distinguish between parameter estimation errors and modeling errors, the existing method is difficult to refine the computational model efficiently. Thus, this study aims to develop a model improvement process that identifies the leading cause of invalidity of a prediction. In this work, an experimental design method is integrated with optimization-based model improvement to minimize the effect of estimation errors in model calibration. Through use of the proposed method, after calibration, the computational model mainly includes the effect of unrecognized modeling errors. Two case studies are provided to confirm the efficacy of the proposed method: an analytical beam study and automotive wheel rim analysis.",Cyber-physical system | D-optimality | Digital twin | Error source identification | Experimental design | Model calibration | Optimization-based model improvement,Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization,2021-11-01,Article,"Son, Hyejeong;Youn, Byeng D.;Kim, Taejin",Exclude,

All rights reserved.The digital twin paradigm aims to fuse information obtained from sensor data, physics models, and operational data for a mechanical component in use to make well-informed decisions regarding health management and operations of the component. In this work, we discuss a methodology for digital-twin-based operation planning in mechanical systems to enable: a) cost-effective maintenance scheduling, and b) resilient operations of the system. As properties of mechanical systems, as well as their operational parameters, loads and environment are stochastic in nature, our methodology includes probabilistic damage diagnosis, probabilistic damage prognosis, and system optimization under uncertainty. As an illustrative example, we consider the problem of fatigue crack growth in a metal component. We discuss a probabilistic, ultrasonic-guided-wave-based crack diagnosis framework that can handle both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties in the diagnosis process. We build a high-fidelity, finite element model to simulate the piezoelectric effect and ultrasonic guided wave propagation. We use test data obtained by conducting diagnostic experiments on the physical twin to calibrate the error in the diagnosis model. We perform Bayesian diagnosis of crack growth using the corrected diagnosis model, considering data corrupted by measurement noise, and fuse the information from multiple sensors. We build a finite-element-based high-fidelity model for crack growth under uniaxial cyclic loading, and calibrate a phenomenological (low-fidelity) fatigue crack growth model using the high-fidelity model output as well as data from fatigue loading experiments performed on the physical twin. We use the resulting multi-fidelity model in a probabilistic crack growth prognosis framework; thus achieving both accuracy and computational efficiency. Lastly, we utilize the damage diagnosis framework along with the damage prognosis model to optimize system operations under diagnostic and prognostic uncertainty.

A shift towards higher degree of automation within existing infrastructure is often challenged by high cost and complex processes, thus a return-on-investment is hardly achievable within decent time. The experience has shown that it is hard to assess all restrictions and interactions between new and old components before any new equipment or infrastructure is implemented and put into operation.

The agent, while constantly interacting with a physical object (electrical grid), searches for an optimal strategy for active network management, which involves short-term strategies capable of controlling the power supplied by generators and/or consumed by the load to avoid overload or voltage problems. Such an agent can verify its training with the initial default policy, which can be considered as a teacher's advice.

First, they have only limited knowledge about the operational environment where the SoS will actually be deployed. Second, the constituent systems which will compose the SoS might not be known a priori (at design-time) or their availability (at run-time) is affected by dynamic factors, due to the openness of the IoT. The consequent research question is thereby how to deal with uncertainty in the design of an SoS architecture on the IoT. To tackle this challenging issue, this paper addresses the notion of uncertainty due to partial information in SoS and proposes an enhanced SoS Architecture Description language (SosADL) for expressing SoS architectures on the IoT under uncertainty. The core SosADL is extended with concurrent constraints and the concept of digital twins coupling the physical and virtual worlds. This novel approach is supported by an integrated toolset, the SosADL Studio. Validation results demonstrate its effectiveness in an SoS architecture for platooning of self-driving vehicles.",Architectural design uncertainty | Digital twins | Internet-of-Things (IoT) | Software architecture description | Systems-of-Systems (SoS),Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2019-01-01,Conference Paper,"Oquendo, Flavio",Exclude,

This is more notorious in a virtual ambient where the data is generated in a manner that is faster and easier to analyze than in the real world. This is very evident in the retail field, where virtual stores have easy access to all the advertisement a user visited and simple to obtain user profile, on the other hand physical stores are limited to basically create a register in a database when there is a purchase. In an attempt to improve the retailers experience from physical stores to manage their business this document has the objective to develop a computational tool that will analyze the people flux going in the establishment, trying to inform the retailer the amount of people and their gender to help the sales process in physical stores.

All rights reserved.Digital twins are essential for Industry 4.0 and the digitalization of research, development and manufacturing. By now, the models contain more and more information and are already often highly complex systems. However, an important step is to keep the model as simple as possible in order to reduce computing resources and the associated simulation time. The Indoor Environment Simulation Suite (IESS) is a tool to generate a zonal model from a CAD geometry. It is designed to simulate the transient indoor climate in a short time, while still considering all important physical processes (heat conduction, radiation, convection). After the zonal model has been generated, the user can parameterize it specifically to the application and couple it with other models when needed. Here, a new approach is to integrate a thermo-physiological model of the human body in order to make statements about the human perception of thermal comfort. This is of particular interest in early development phases in order to assess air conditioning strategies as well as structural or technical adaptions due to thermal bridges or other influences on the cabin climate. In this paper a concept will be presented where the zonal model is coupled with the thermo-physiological model to investigate selected case studies on how thermal comfort in a regional aircraft can be assessed and considered in early design phases. The cabin model is based on a new type of regional aircraft for which a mock-up is currently being built in order to perform subject test at the Fraunhofer Institute in Holzkirchen. The thermal model can thus make statements in advance about how test scenarios should be carried out in order to gain the greatest possible benefit from the subject study tests, where the number of different tests is limited.",,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2021-01-22,Conference Paper,"Lindner, A.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.During the last years, several research activities and studies have presented the possibility to perform manufacturing control using distributed approaches. Although these new approaches aim to deliver more flexibility and adaptability to the shop floor, they are not being readily adopted and utilised by the manufacturers. One of the main challenges is the unpredictability of the proposed solutions and the uncertainty associated with these approaches. Hence, the proposed research aims to explore the utilisation of Digital Twins (DTs) to predict and understand the execution of these systems in runtime. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is leading to the emergence of new concepts amongst which DT stand out. Given their early stage, however, the already existing implementations are far from standardised, meaning that each practical case has to be analysed on its own and solutions are often created from scratch. Taking the aforementioned into account, the authors suggest an architecture that enables the integration between a previously designed and developed agent-based distributed control system and its DT, whose implementation is also provided in detail. Furthermore, the digital model’s calibration is described jointly with the careful validation process carried out. Thanks to the latter, several conclusions and guidelines for future implementations were possible to derive as well.",Cyber-Physical Production System | Digital Twin | Distributed control systems | Industrial agents | Multi-Agent System | Simulation,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),2021-03-01,Article,"Rolo, Gonçalo Roque;Rocha, Andre Dionisio;Tripa, João;Barata, Jose",Exclude,

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Surrogate Modeling (SM) is often used to reduce the computational burden of time-consuming system simulations. However, continuous advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the spread of embedded sensors have led to the creation of Digital Twins (DT), Design Mining (DM), and Soft Sensors (SS). These methodologies represent a new challenge for the generation of surrogate models since they require the implementation of elaborated artificial intelligence algorithms and minimize the number of physical experiments measured. To reduce the assessment of a physical system, several existing adaptive sequential sampling methodologies have been developed; however, they are limited in most part to the Kriging models and Kriging-model-based Monte Carlo Simulation. In this paper, we integrate a distinct adaptive sampling methodology to an automated machine learning methodology (AutoML) to help in the process of model selection while minimizing the system evaluation and maximizing the system performance for surrogate models based on artificial intelligence algorithms. In each iteration, this framework uses a grid search algorithm to determine the best candidate models and perform a leave-one-out cross-validation to calculate the performance of each sampled point. A Voronoi diagram is applied to partition the sampling region into some local cells, and the Voronoi vertexes are considered as new candidate points. The performance of the sample points is used to estimate the accuracy of the model for a set of candidate points to select those that will improve more the model’s accuracy. Then, the number of candidate models is reduced. Finally, the performance of the framework is tested using two examples to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method.",Adaptive sequential sampling | Machine learning | Surrogate model,Sensors (Switzerland),2020-09-02,Article,"Duchanoy, Carlos A.;Calvo, Hiram;Moreno-Armendáriz, Marco A.",Exclude,

For basic product lines of modest size or complexity, one or several modular feature trees can be sufficient for managing the and resolving the variation present across the engineering assets in the systems engineering 'V' - from requirements, to design, through implementation, verification, validation, documentation, and more - in the software, mechanical, and electrical disciplines. However, enterprises seeking to adopt PLE at all levels of their organization, including areas such as product marketing, portfolio planning, manufacturing, supply chain, product sales, product service and maintenance, Internet-of-Things, resource planning, and much more are finding that thousands of nonengineering users need different views and interaction scenarios with a feature diversity representation. This paper describes a feature ontology (a specification of the meaning of terms in the feature modeling realm) that is suitable for managing the feature-based product line engineering and operations in the largest and most complex product line organizations. This ontology is based on layers of abstraction that each incrementally constrain the complexity and combinatorics and targets specific roles in the organization for greater degrees of efficiency, precision, and automation across an entire business enterprise.",Bill-of-features | Enterprise feature ontology | Feature modeling | Feature profiles | Feature-based product line engineering | Ple factory | Product configurator | Product line engineering | Product portfolio | Software product lines | Variation points,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2017-09-25,Conference Paper,"Krueger, Charles;Clements, Paul",Exclude,

Test conditions hardly take into account the variability that occur in everyday traffic - adverse weather conditions such as fog, rain, snow or darkness are typically not considered, nor are the resulting changes in, e.g., the behavior of pedestrians. In an emergency braking situation, the behavior of the VRU can also be directly affected by the interaction with the vehicle. For example, a pedestrian might be alarmed by an approaching car. This could elicit a very different response in the human that cannot be simulated in the dummy motion as defined in the standard test procedure. In order to create a more versatile and interactive simulation and test environment, we have developed the Mixed Reality Test Environment MiRE.

These advances push the standard approach of media architecture to embed screens in the built environment to its limits because screens lack the immersive capacity that newer media afford. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel AR approach to media architecture that uses a Digital Twin as a platform for structuring and accessing data from various sources, including IoT and simulations. Our technical contribution to media architecture is threefold. First, we extend the possibilities of media architecture beyond embedded screens to three dimensions by presenting a Digital Twin using AR with a head-mounted display. This approach results in a shared and consistent augmented experience across large architectural spaces. Second, we use the Digital Twin to integrate and visualize real physical sensor information. Third, we make artificial occupancy simulations accessible to everyday users by presenting them within their natural context in the Digital Twin. Observing the Digital Twin in situ of the Physical Twin also has applications beyond media architecture. Fusing the two twins using AR can reduce the cognitive load of users from consuming big and complex information sources and enhance their experience. We present two use cases of the proposed Fused Twins in a university building at ETH Zürich. In the first use case, we visualize a dense indoor sensor network (DISN) with 390 IoT sensors that collected data from March 2020 to May 2021. In the second use case, we immerse visitors in agent-based simulations to enable insights into the real and projected uses of space.

The availability to leverage machine data allows the concept of the Digital Twin. The more data that is collected the more statistically relevant and reliable the digital representation. This data within the Digital Twin is usually hard to access and to consume by humans. Typically, there is just a web-based user interface or basic queries available to mine the data. Therefore, we propose the concept of a Virtual Twin, which is an interactive virtual representation (virtual 3D model) of a physical object. The benefit of a Virtual Twin is that machines and equipment are arranged in the same way and at the same position in relation to each other as their real-world counterparts. The virtual 3D representation functions as an intuitive gateway to the corresponding Digital Twin.

This is currently supported by adding external Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) to installations. As IoT software ecosystems become wide-spread, the need for such hardware will decrease. However, removing the controllers opens the challenge of configuring distributed industrial installations. This paper argues for modeling application requirements on industrial installations so that they can be evaluated automatically based on information about targeted installations. GIMLE, a visual language for modeling application requirements using expressive domain knowledge, is proposed.

CSRs have a peculiar behavior when illuminated: they reflect light and produce unique optical patterns whose full display is hardly predictable. They have been argued to behave like an optical Physical Unclonable Function (PUF), therefore finding application in anti-counterfeiting, in particular for object authentication. However, a fundamental challenge remains open: to understand what makes each optical response unique and how to extract this identifying information reliably and repeatedly. We study the problem, and we design and discuss two pivotal procedures to build authentication protocols for objects coated with CSRs. We test the quality of our procedures against large data sets of pattern images: images from CSRs are used to calculate inter- and intra-distance; simulated patterns created artificially are used to measure security in terms of false positive ratio. Our procedures successfully cluster images coming from the same CSR, distinguishing them from images of different CSRs and decoys. Our work is one of the few that has studied procedures of information extraction for materials derived from CSRs. It advances the state of the art in this area, closing the gap between the research on optical PUFs and practical applications.",anti-counterfeiting Cholesteric Spherical Reflectors | authentication | Physical unclonable function,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2021-08-17,Conference Paper,"Arenas, Monica;Demirci, Huseyin;Lenzini, Gabriele",Exclude,

Although the application of CPSs promise to positively transform many application fields, there are still many open questions and challenges on how to design and realize a CPS. As indicated in the third level of the 5-level CPS architecture, the so-called cyber level, one of the challenges addresses the need for digital twins as high-fidelity mirroring images of CPSs entities. This is a prerequisite to realize the upper levels of the 5-level CPS architecture-the cognition and configuration level. In the scientific literature, the concept of a Digital Twin is introduced as a concrete realization for mirroring physical entities in the virtual world. However, a reference framework for the main building blocks of a Digital Twin framework is missing. This hinders a reuse of best practices and proven solutions for concrete realizations of a Digital Twin. In order to tackle this problem, we have established a reference framework for Digital Twins within a CPS. Our framework specifies the main building blocks of a Digital Twin in terms of structure and interrelations. To achieve this goal, we performed a systematic literature review, where we evaluated existing Digital Twin realizations used in different application domains of CPSs and we applied Grounded Theory and Framework Analysis as underlying methodologies. This reference framework serves a blueprint for developing Digital Twins of physical entities which are part of a CPS.",cyber-physical system | digital twin | reference framework,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE/ACM 5th International Workshop on Software Engineering for Smart Cyber-Physical Systems, SEsCPS 2019",2019-05-01,Conference Paper,"Josifovska, Klementina;Yigitbas, Enes;Engels, Gregor",Exclude,

While these mobility service providers have some degree of control over the market by assigning vehicles to requests, they need to deal with the uncertainty arising from self-interested driver behavior since workers are usually free to drive when they are not assigned tasks. If a driver's behavior can be accurately replicated on the digital twin, more detailed and realistic counterfactual simulations will enable decision making to improve mobility services as well as to validate urban planning. In this work, we formulate the problem of passenger-vehicle matching in a sparsely connected graph and proposed an algorithm to derive an equilibrium policy in a multi-agent environment. Our framework combines value iteration methods to estimate the optimal policy given expected state visitation and policy propagation to compute multi-agent state visitation frequencies. Furthermore, we developed a method to learn the driver's reward function transferable to an environment with significantly different dynamics from training data. We evaluated the robustness to changes in spatio-temporal supply-demand distributions and deterioration in data quality using a real-world taxi trajectory dataset; our approach significantly outperforms several baselines in terms of imitation accuracy. The computational time required to obtain an equilibrium policy shared by all vehicles does not depend on the number of agents, and even on the scale of real-world services, it takes only a few seconds on a single CPU.",Counterfactual simulation | Equilibrium | Inverse reinforcement learning | Markov games,"The Web Conference 2021 - Proceedings of the World Wide Web Conference, WWW 2021",2021-04-19,Conference Paper,"Oda, Takuma",Exclude,

Expedient operation is only possible when all systems cooperate as expected. This requires a level of trust between the components of the ecosystem. New systems that join the ecosystem therefore first need to build up a level of trust. Humans derive trust from behavioral reputation in key situations. In Smart Ecosystems (SES), the reputation of a system or system component can also be based on observation of its behavior. In this paper, we introduce a method and a test platform that support virtual evaluation of decisions at runtime, thereby supporting trust building within SES. The key idea behind the platform is that it employs and evaluates Digital Twins, which are executable models of system components, to learn about component behavior in observed situations. The trust in the Digital Twin then builds up over time based on the behavioral compliance of the real system component with its Digital Twin.

Digital Twins take on a unique role here. However, the question of what a Digital Twin is and what differentiates it from a regular model is still open. We present an experimental setup for integrating an existing simulation model of Hamburg's traffic system with the city's real-time sensor network. The Digital Twin is implemented using the large-scale multi-agent framework MARS. The entire process from the model description to retrieving real-time data from the IoT sensors and incorporating it in the simulation is presented. As a first prototypical example, a multi-modal mobility model was connected to real-world bike-sharing locations in Hamburg. We find that the combination of multi-agent systems and IoT sensors as a Digital Twin shows enormous potential for city planners, policy stakeholders, and other decision-makers.

Quantifying the strength of these interactions (the so called 'binding affinity') is a grand challenge of computational chemistry, surmounting which could revolutionize drug design and provide the platform for patient specific medicine. Recently, evidence from blind challenge predictions and retrospective validation studies has suggested that molecular dynamics (MD) can now achieve useful predictive accuracy (1 kcal/mol) This accuracy is sufficient to greatly accelerate hit to lead and lead optimization. To translate these advances in predictive accuracy so as to impact clinical and/or industrial decision making requires that binding free energy results must be turned around on reduced timescales without loss of accuracy. This demands advances in algorithms, scalable software systems, and intelligent and efficient utilization of supercomputing resources. This work is motivated by the real world problem of providing insight from drug candidate data on a time scale that is as short as possible. Specifically, we reproduce results from a collaborative project between UCL and GlaxoSmithKline to study a congeneric series of drug candidates binding to the BRD4 protein-inhibitors of which have shown promising preclinical efficacy in pathologies ranging from cancer to inflammation. We demonstrate the use of a framework called HTBAC, designed to support the aforementioned requirements of accurate and rapid drug binding affinity calculations. HTBAC facilitates the execution of the numbers of simulations while supporting the adaptive execution of algorithms.

Existing methods either rely on network level data or replay recorded user actions to approximate real users in a network. Our work produces generative models trained on actual user data (sequences of application usage) collected from endpoints. Once trained to the user's behavioral data, these models can generate novel sequences of actions from the same distribution as the training data. These sequences of actions are then fed to our custom software via configuration files, which replicate those behaviors on end devices. Notably, our models are platform agnostic and could generate behavior data for any emulation software package. In this paper we present our model generation process, software architecture, and an investigation of the fidelity of our models. Specifically, we consider two different representations of the behavioral sequences, on which three standard generative models for sequential data-Markov Chain, Hidden Markov Model, and Random Surfer-are employed. Additionally, we examine adding a latent variable to faithfully capture time-of-day trends. Best results are observed when sampling a unique next behavior (regardless of the specific sequential model used) and the duration to take the behavior, paired with the temporal latent variable. Our software is currently deployed in a cyber range to help evaluate the efficacy of defensive cyber technologies, and we suggest additional ways that the cyber community as a whole can benefit from more realistic user behavior emulation.",data driven | data sets | experimental infrastructure | user emulation,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2021-08-09,Conference Paper,"Oesch, Sean;Bridges, Robert A.;Verma, Miki;Weber, Brian;Diallo, Oumar",Exclude,

This automation enables numerous useful real-life use-cases, such as smart transport, smart living, smart cities, and so on. However, recent industry surveys reflect that data-related challenges are responsible for slower growth of IoT in recent years. For this reason, this article presents a systematic and comprehensive survey on IoT Big Data (IoTBD) with the aim to identify the uncharted challenges for IoTBD. This article analyzes the state-of-the-art academic works in IoT and big data management across various domains and proposes a taxonomy for IoTBD management. Then, the survey explores the IoT portfolio of major cloud vendors and provides a classification of vendor services for the integration of IoT and IoTBD on their cloud platforms. After that, the survey identifies the IoTBD challenges in terms of 13 V's challenges and envisions IoTBD as ""Big Data 2.0.""Then the survey provides comprehensive analysis of recent works that address IoTBD challenges by highlighting their strengths and weaknesses to assess the recent trends and future research directions.

Using actual data, we examine if the data model and visualization design correspond with the zoom level. Owing to the comparative examination of the wide-area display performance and the map representation design in a JavaScript-based open-source library, we were able to develop a platform with light architecture and an easily customizable display. Furthermore, prototyping, based on Mapbox GL JS and Deck.GL, and the display of spatiotemporal flow layers, such as background maps, point cloud data in many places, dozens of layer display types, and the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) allowed for the seamless transition from the local government to the wide-area display in the prefecture unit in approximately 10-20 s. It is recommended that this digital smart city platform should be standardized by other local governments, especially in areas where higher-order data visualization is yet to advance. To display this digital city in a lightweight environment, we consider the digital data situation of local governments in Japan. It is necessary to define the visualized design for each zoom level according to the characteristics of the data. We then arranged the display model of each zoom level for 20 types of urban infrastructure data related to the digital smart city by referring to the style schema of the tile form.

But, there are still many challenges when applied in production areas, e.g. as part of a virtual assistant to support workers in knowledge-intensive maintenance work. Regarding input modalities, touchscreens are failure-prone in wet environments and the quality of voice recognition is negatively affected by ambient noise. Augmenting a symmetric text- and voice-based user interface with gestural input poses a good solution to provide both efficiency and a robust communication. This paper contributes to this research area by providing results on the application of appropriate head and one-hand gestures during maintenance work. We conducted an elicitation study with 20 participants and present a gesture set as its outcome. To facilitate the gesture development and integration for application designers, a classification model for head gestures and one for one-hand gestures were developed. Additionally, a proof-of-concept for operators' acceptance regarding a multimodal conversational user interface with support of gestural input during maintenance work was demonstrated. It encompasses two usability testings with 18 participants in different realistic, but controlled settings: notebook repair (SUS: 82.1) and cutter head maintenance (SUS: 82.7).",Assistance systems | conversational agent | elicitation study | industry 4.0 | multimodal interface | task guidance | user-defined gestures,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2021-09-05,Conference Paper,"Fleiner, Christian;Riedel, Till;Beigl, Michael;Ruoff, Marcel",Exclude,

For students, certain gaze patterns have been shown to correlate with interest in the material, while for instructors, student-centered gaze patterns have been shown to increase approachability and immediacy. Unfortunately, prior classroom gaze-sensing systems have limited accuracy and often require specialized external or worn sensors.

Negative stress exposure influences mission success or the short- and long-term health conditions of deployed personnel. To quantify negative stress, we introduce a washable smart textile with integrated sensors. Analyzing the transmitted sensor values, medical advisors monitor up to 72 sensor values in parallel in case of an average group size of eight people. In order to aggregate the amount of data, we propose a stress level scale that includes stress trends. To predict individual stress levels based on sensor data, environmental quantities and the individual physiological fingerprint, we train different machine learning models. To evaluate such models, we implement a data acquisition environment to label data snapshots. Therefore, we do not need to collect in-field data and expose humans to negative stress. Moreover, we can mock sensor failures and rare, but relevant, sensor value combinations that are difficult to acquire in real-world scenarios. Our evaluation environment identifies Random Forest Regressor from a set of 25 models to perform best to predict individual stress levels. This model performs 23.19 times better than a zero rule classifier to distinguish among nine stress levels for mission goal health condition and 10.50 times better for mission goal mission success.

Evolving it to high-fidelity digital twin is desirable for the management and operations of large-scale data centers. Manually calibrating CFD model parameters to achieve twin-class fidelity by specially trained domain expert is tedious and labor-intensive. To reduce manual efforts, existing automatic calibration approaches developed for various computational models apply heuristics to search model configurations within an empirically defined parameter bound. However, in the context of CFD, each search step requires long-lasting CFD model's iterated solving, rendering these approaches impractical with increased model complexity. This paper presents Kalibre, a knowledge-based neural surrogate approach that performs CFD model calibration by iterating four key steps of i) training a neural surrogate model based on CFD-generated data, ii) finding the optimal parameters at the moment through neural surrogate retraining based on sensor-measured data, iii) configuring the found parameters back to the CFD model, and iv) validating the CFD model using sensor-measured data as the ground truth. Thus, the parameter search is offloaded to the neural surrogate which is ultra-faster than CFD model's iterated solving. To speed up the convergence of Kalibre, we integrate prior knowledge of the twinned data center's thermophysics into the neural surrogate design to improve its learning efficiency. With about five hours computation on a 32-core processor, Kalibre achieves mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 0.81°C and 0.75°C in calibrating two CFD models for two production data halls hosting thousands of servers each while requires fewer CFD solving processes than existing baseline approaches.",CFD | Data center | Digital twin | Knowledge-based neural net | Surrogate model,"BuildSys 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM International Conference on Systems for Energy-Efficient Buildings, Cities, and Transportation",2020-11-18,Conference Paper,"Wang, Ruihang;Zhou, Xin;Dong, Linsen;Wen, Yonggang;Tan, Rui;Chen, Li;Wang, Guan;Zeng, Feng",Exclude,

Although ways to implement personality traits into the virtual agents' movement have been widely researched, ways to create aspects of individuality that can be identified as belonging to specific individuals have not. To clarify how well humans can identify individuals from short movements and what elements of movement contribute to the perception of individuality, we examined the relationship between the degree of confidence in personal identification and statics of gesture movement. In the experiment, participants were asked to compare pairs of short presentation animations and give their degree of confidence that the two animations were of the same person. The animations were created with motion data from performers and with 3D-CG characters to reduce the differences in appearances and shot angles. We calculated five expressivity parameters from the wrist movement for each gesture and compared the answers from the participants. The results showed that the participants were able to distinguish individuals doing the same action and recognize the individuals by the spatial and temporal extents of their movement, which were represented by how much space they use and how fast they moved their wrists.

Thus, there is an increasing impetus to use simulation techniques such as discrete-event simulation, agent-based simulation, and hybrid simulation in the context of SCM. In conventional supply chain simulation, the underlying constituents of the system like manufacturing, distribution, retail, and logistics processes are often modelled and executed as a single model. Unlike this conventional approach, a distributed supply chain simulation (DSCS) enables the coordinated execution of simulation models using specialist software. To understand the current state-of-the-art of DSCS, this paper presents a methodological review and categorization of literature in DSCS using a framework-based approach. Through a study of over 130 articles, we report on the motivation for using DSCS, the modelling techniques, the underlying distributed computing technologies and middleware, its advantages and a future agenda, and also limitations and trade-offs that may be associated with this approach. The increasing adoption of technologies like Internet-of-Things and Cloud Computing will ensure the availability of both data and models for distributed decision-making, which is likely to enable data-driven DSCS of the future.

It is therefore a software system that simulates another software system, making it conceptually truly a twin, blurring the distinction between the simulated and the simulator.

At the same time, the feasibility analysis of this scheme was carried out by studying the existing related cases.

The proposed software pipeline consists of nine main stages: 1) RGB-D acquisition; 2) 2D feature extraction; 3) camera pose estimation; 4) point cloud generation; 5) coarse mesh reconstruction; 6) optional loop closure; 7) fine mesh reconstruction; 8) UV unwrapping; and 9) texture projection. This end-To-end scheme combines multiple state-of-The-Art techniques and provides an easy-To-use software package for real-Time 3D model reconstruction and offline texture mapping. The main innovation lies in various Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques that are used with additional depth data to yield high-quality 3D models in real-Time and at low cost. The functionality of Open3DGen has been validated on AMD Ryzen 3900X CPU and Nvidia GTX1080 GPU. This proof-of-concept setup attains an average processing speed of 15 fps for 720p (1280x720) RGBD input without the offline backend. Our solution is shown to provide competitive 3D mesh quality and execution performance with the state-of-The-Art commercial and academic solutions.,3D model reconstruction | camera pose estimation | feature extraction | mesh reconstruction | point cloud generation | RGB-D acquisition | texture mapping,MMSys 2021 - Proceedings of the 2021 Multimedia Systems Conference,2021-07-15,Conference Paper,"Niemirepo, Teo T.;Viitanen, Marko;Vanne, Jarno",Exclude,

It is highly desirable to be able to anticipate the occurrence of such events in advance to reduce the potential social upheaval and damage caused. Event prediction, which has traditionally been prohibitively challenging, is now becoming a viable option in the big data era and is thus experiencing rapid growth, also thanks to advances in high performance computers and new Artificial Intelligence techniques. There is a large amount of existing work that focuses on addressing the challenges involved, including heterogeneous multi-faceted outputs, complex (e.g., spatial, temporal, and semantic) dependencies, and streaming data feeds. Due to the strong interdisciplinary nature of event prediction problems, most existing event prediction methods were initially designed to deal with specific application domains, though the techniques and evaluation procedures utilized are usually generalizable across different domains. However, it is imperative yet difficult to cross-reference the techniques across different domains, given the absence of a comprehensive literature survey for event prediction. This article aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive survey of the technologies, applications, and evaluations of event prediction in the big data era. First, systematic categorization and summary of existing techniques are presented, which facilitate domain experts' searches for suitable techniques and help model developers consolidate their research at the frontiers. Then, comprehensive categorization and summary of major application domains are provided to introduce wider applications to model developers to help them expand the impacts of their research. Evaluation metrics and procedures are summarized and standardized to unify the understanding of model performance among stakeholders, model developers, and domain experts in various application domains. Finally, open problems and future directions are discussed.",artificial intelligence | big data | Event prediction,ACM Computing Surveys,2022-06-30,Review,"Zhao, Liang",Exclude,

During the procedure, physicians diagnose the condition of the heart and locate ablation sites by analyzing electrical signals sensed by catheters inserted into the heart. Due to the limited observation of the patient's heart, there may exist multiple heart conditions that can explain historical observations, causing ambiguities in the patient's heart condition. During the procedure, physicians have to visualize and continuously update these suspected heart conditions in their mind, causing heavy mental burden on the physicians. In this paper, cardiac electrophysiology is formalized using a physiological model of the heart, such that the diagnosis problem during cardiac ablation can be formalized as parameter identification and state estimation problems with the heart model. We then propose a model-based clinical assist system which partially solves the diagnosis problem during cardiac ablation. The system enumerates suspected heart conditions by creating ""digital twins""of the patient's heart with heart models. The heart models are used to represent and visualize suspected heart conditions, and are systematically updated and removed with new information during the ablation procedure. The system provides more rigorous and intuitive interpretation of current understanding of the patient's heart, and improves the accuracy and efficiency of cardiac ablation procedures by relieving the physicians from demanding low-level reasoning.",digital twin | knowledge representation | system identification,ICCPS 2021 - Proceedings of the 2021 ACM/IEEE 12th International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (with CPS-IoT Week 2021),2021-05-19,Conference Paper,"Wu, Yutong;Tang, Renzhi;Kang, Eunsuk;Jiang, Zhihao",Exclude,

Digital twins provide a promising approach to monitor existing buildings and further increase their energy efficiency. A digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a physical entity. It has several applications in product design, product cycle, and fault detection. This paper presents a hybrid approach that combines physics-based and machine learning methods to create a DT for the built environment.

Both the digital twin and its physical counterpart, called a plant, are highly intertwined such that they continuously exchange data to reveal useful information about the overall system. Such class of CPSs need to be robust to various types of disturbances, such as faulty sensors and model discrepancies, since the interplay between the physical plant's operation and digital twin's simulation may lead to undesirable or even destructive effect. To address this problem, this paper introduces a flexible anomaly detection framework for monitoring anomalous behaviours in digital twin based CPSs. In particular, our approach integrates both the digital twin and data-driven techniques that detect and classify anomalous behaviours due to modelling errors (e.g. incomplete models) and sensor and physical system's faults. The framework can be deployed to any general CPSs without the full knowledge of the digital twin's internal model. Therefore, our method is amenable to various types of digital twin implementations that enhance the traditional data-driven anomaly detection mechanism. We demonstrate the performance of our approach using the Tennessee Eastman Process model. The experimental result shows our approach is able to effectively detect and classify anomaly sources from the physical plant, sensor and digital twin, even in the situation when a certain combination of multiple anomalies occur simultaneously.",anomaly detection | cyber-physical system | digital twin | discrepancy monitoring,ICCPS 2021 - Proceedings of the 2021 ACM/IEEE 12th International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (with CPS-IoT Week 2021),2021-05-19,Conference Paper,"Gao, Chuanchao;Park, Heejong;Easwaran, Arvind",Exclude,

Due to their high digitization and controllable energy systems, the DCs can act as flexible assets, being able to dynamically adapt their energy profiles and valuable energy services. We present a flexibility management solution that is using a Digital Twin model of DC systems to determine action plans for shifting energy load. DC monitored data is acquired by integration with existing DC infrastructure management (DCIM) while energy predictions are computed for DC energy demand, energy flexibility, and heat generation. The flexibility optimization plans for DC operation are determined and enforced after DC manager validation via DCIM integration. Five energy services are identified as suitable to be provided by the DC with the help of described flexibility management solution: energy trading for increasing profit, grid congestion management by decreasing DC energy demand, scheduling by increasing DC energy demand to consume as much as possible the renewable available in the local grid, power factor compensation and sell heat on demand.",Data Centers | Energy Flexibility Management | Energy Services | Heat Reuse | Smart Grid,e-Energy 2021 - Proceedings of the 2021 12th ACM International Conference on Future Energy Systems,2021-06-22,Conference Paper,"Antal, Marcel;Cioara, Tudor;Anghel, Ionut;Antal, Claudia;Salomie, Ioan",Exclude,

In the coming years they will be introduced on a large scale in the industry and in other spheres. A wide range of digital twins will be in demand: from separate components to complex technical facilities, such as automobiles, airplanes, manufacturing lines, factories, corporations, etc. To provide their successful interaction, it is important to create digital twins on the uniform principles. Currently, creating a digital twin is a complex scientific issue. It presents difficulties because it is necessary not only to describe physical (or chemical, biological, etc.) processes going on in the object, but also to envisage significant changes of its properties in the course of its operation. In this case the digital twin is supposed to adapt to the changes in the original object in accordance with the data received from the sensors. The aim of the research was to define the strategies of solving the current problems in such areas as digital twins, the internet of things and cyberphysical systems. In order to achieve this aim, the following problems were supposed to be solved: - Consider the definitions of the digital twin suggested in the world scientific literature - Find a unified data-driven real-time approach to creating digital twins - Suggest using the neural network approach in creating digital twins. During the use of the modelled object, specifics of the physical processes going on in it and object properties can change. The model is supposed to adapt in accordance with these changes, which is rather difficult if a model is generated by applying computer-aided engineering software packages (CAE) based on classical numerical methods. We consider the multistage technique as more promising. It involves building an adaptive model at the second stage. Such a model can be specified and redesigned based on real-time data. Since neural networks have proved to be efficient in solving complicated problems related to data processing, we recommend using them as the basic class of mathematical models for creating digital twins.",data set | digital twins | Industry 4.0 | mathematical model | neural network modelling,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2020-10-22,Conference Paper,"Dashkina, Alexandra;Khalyapina, Ludmila;Kobicheva, Aleksandra;Lazovskaya, Tatiana;Malykhina, Galina;Tarkhov, Dmitriy",Exclude,

The SIUS idea helps to recognize or improve the data driving city concept, because of smart and gamification technology use, so that greater range of digital services related to the sociocultural city facets can be provided to different stakeholders. The study includes exploring the interaction of pervasive processes of the Sociocultural Information Urban Space, specification of its architecture and concept. Based on the principles and practices of a pervasive approach, the main mechanisms of citizens' involvement into the active creative development of the SIUS are identified.

One way to achieve such monitoring is via co-simulation of a modelled system corresponding to the deployed system. Our work addresses the topic of brokering external data into an Functional Mock-up Interface 2.0 enabled co-simulation via a Functional Mock-up Unit (a simulation unit) called RabbitMQ FMU and an external message queue. Our contribution includes a formal specification that captures the semantics of RabbitMQ FMU and ensures a maximum delay on the messages relayed to the co-simulation even through an unreliable network. This formal specification is used to generate test cases that exercise all states and transitions. The implementation is subjected to these test cases to verify that it is a refinement of the specification.

These telecom companies chiefly need an ability to introduce right product offerings at the right time, identify what to cross-sell and upsell to whom, and make timely course correction on engagement services. The current practice of meeting these needs in experience-centric and intuition-driven manner is turning out to be ineffective in the increasingly dynamic business environment.

Co-simulation plays a key role in this by allowing the system as a whole to be simulated by composing simulations of its parts. The ability to do this coupling relies on the models adhering to a well-defined interface. The Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) defines this interface and the models that implemented it are called Functional Mockup Units (FMUs). While a wealth of specialized simulation tools can generate FMUs, they are often commercial and do not support of complex software prototypes. Rather than implement these as FMUs from scratch (FMI requires expertise in C), losing valuable time, the contribution presented in this paper is a tool that allows FMUs to be implemented rapidly in Python.

To support personalization of high quality products, companies try to establish Information Technology (IT) systems. Typical IT systems are Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) used in the design department and Manufacturing Execution System (MES) used in the production department. Problems arise during the production of such highly personalized products using only information from 2D drawings. It is also inefficient that information about malfunctions and defects during production is sent back to the design department through manual operations. To resolve these problems, a method of exchanging the 3D shape with malfunction and defect information between PLM and MES is proposed. 3D shapes have been exchanged using open source and web-based PLM, MES, and CAD systems. The result shows that interoperability between PLM and MES is possible with visualization support.",3D note | 3D shape | MES | Modification | PLM | X3D,Proceedings - Web3D 2020: 25th ACM Conference on 3D Web Technology,2020-11-09,Conference Paper,"Jauhar, Tahir Abbas;Safdar, Mutahar;Kim, Imgyu;Han, Soonhung",Exclude,

Machine tool should be digital and intelligent, providing some manufacturing service via the Internet of Things. In order to solve the dynamic machine tool selection (DMTS), this paper proposes a novel decision-making approach based on real-time multi-agent. Firstly, the machine tool digital twin (MTDT) is introduced to provide real-time device data for evaluating machine tools. Based on MTDT, a real-time multi-agent-based mechanism (RTMAM) is designed for solving DMTS. Then based on exponential scale, the Analytic Hierarchy Process is modified for calculating the weight of evaluation index.

Model-based Engineering and DevOps aim to efficiently deliver software with increased quality. Model-based Engineering relies on models as first-class artifacts to analyze, simulate, and ultimately generate parts of a system. DevOps focuses on software engineering activities, from early development to integration, and then improvement through the monitoring of the system at run-time. We claim these can be efficiently combined to improve the engineering process of CPS. In this paper, we present TwinOps, a process that unifies Model-based Engineering, Digital Twins, and DevOps practice in a uniform workflow.

This work takes place in the context of the digitalization of the mail sorting process at La Poste, the French national postal service company. Indeed, La Poste is currently investing on robotics modules for automatically loading mail containers. The main objective is to reduce the painful work for human operators while optimizing the robots usage. We already worked on targeting such a balance in a past effort that resulted in the production of different kinds of models of the La Poste CPPS. However, these models were defined separately and are not directly related to the underlying business process in particular. Thus, we propose an MPM approach starting from this business process as now modeled explicitly in a BPMN model. Then, we refine the high-level business activities into finer-grained activities represented in a UML Activity model. From these latest, we derive the specification of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) developed with the JADE framework and emulating the behavior of the La Poste CPPS. Our longer term objective is to pave the way for supporting the definition of a DT for this CPPS, and potentially for other CPPSs in different contexts in the future.",Activity modeling | Agent-based modeling | Business process modeling | Cyber-physical production systems | Digital twin | Multi-paradigm modeling,"Proceedings - 23rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS-C 2020 - Companion Proceedings",2020-10-16,Conference Paper,"Niati, Asmaa;Selma, Cyrine;Tamzalit, Dalila;Bruneliere, Hugo;Mebarki, Nasser;Cardin, Olivier",Exclude,

By introduction of Internet of Things (IoT), and Industry 4.0, CPSs are used in an interconnected way each of which may belong to a different stakeholder, building a complex System of Systems (SoS) called CPSoS. These systems need to employ some techniques to transform the collected data to knowledge with which the system can make better decisions. These capabilities can create smart CPSoS or sCPSoS. However, these systems are highly complex from both structural and behavioural point of views. Naturally, there is a need for multiple abstraction levels using different paradigms to model these system, called Multi-Paradigm modeling (MPM). In this paper, the challenges and opportunities of using agent technologies, including intelligent agents, Agent-based modeling and Simulation (ABM), and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) (or Agent-oriented Software Engineering (AOSE)) in an integrated way with Model-based System Engineering (MBSE) techniques are discussed to cover the whole lifecycle of sCPSoS, from simulation and analysis, to development, operation and monitoring.",Agent-based modeling | Agent-oriented software engineering | Model-based system engineering | Multi-agent systems | Multi-paradigm modeling | Smart cyber-physical system of systems,"Proceedings - 23rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS-C 2020 - Companion Proceedings",2020-10-16,Conference Paper,"Challenger, Moharram;Vangheluwe, Hans",Exclude,

As a result, the organizations responsible for corporate security, the Security Operations Center (SOC), are overwhelmed with the integration of the industrial systems. To facilitate monitoring the industrial assets, digital twins represent a helpful novel concept. They are the virtual counterparts of such assets and provide valuable insights through collecting asset-centric data, analytic capabilities and simulations. Moreover, digital twins can assist enterprise security by simulating attacks and analyzing the effect on the virtual counterpart. However, the integration of digital twin security simulations into enterprise security strategies, that are mainly controlled by the SOC, is currently neglected. To close this research gap, this work develops a process-based security framework to incorporate digital twin security simulations in the SOC. In the course of this work, a use case along with a digital twin-based security simulation provides proof of concept. It is demonstrated how a man-in-the-middle attack can be performed in a simulated industry setting and how it affects the systems. Moreover, we show how the resulting system logs can support the SOC by building technical rules to implement in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.",Digital twin | Security framework | Security information and event management | Security operations center,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2020-08-25,Conference Paper,"Dietz, Marietheres;Vielberth, Manfred;Pernul, Günther",Exclude,

A threat model was used as input to guide the construction of the CPS model where control components which are within the adversary's intent and capabilities are extracted. The relevant control components are subsequently modeled together with their control dependencies and operational design specifications. The approach was demonstrated and validated on a water treatment testbed. Attacks were simulated on the testbed model where its resilience to attacks was evaluated using proposed metrics such as Impact Ratio and Time-to-Critical-State. From the analysis of the attacks, design strengths and weaknesses were identified and design improvements were recommended to increase the testbed's resilience to attacks.",cascading impact of attacks | cyber-physical systems security | dynamical systems modeling | resilience engineering | security evaluation,"CPSS 2020 - Proceedings of the 6th ACM Cyber-Physical System Security Workshop, Co-located with AsiaCCS 2020",2020-10-06,Conference Paper,"Hau, Zhongyuan;Castellanos, John Henry;Zhou, Jianying",Exclude,

Usually, for a complex product such as in the aerospace industry, the number of requirements is numerous and as one of the methodologies is Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) that copes these challenges according to stakeholders needs. Models in MBSE have a different physics nature and specifically for the aerospace industry it can be approximations which are based on the statistical data or 1D models based on the physical equations. Despite MBSE approach solves a wide range of the issues on the high level of product development and helps to choose appropriate architecture, the technical requirements are usually not taken into account on that stage.

However, current methods are largely restricted to single buildings; these methods require energy and occupancy monitoring sensor deployments, which can be expensive and difficult to deploy at scale. Further, current methods for estimating energy consumption and population cannot provide fine enough temporal or spatial granularity for a reasonable personal energy footprint estimate. In this work, we present CityEnergy, a data-driven system for city-wide estimation of personal energy footprints.

The Robot Operating System (ROS), a middleware infrastructure for robotic systems, is widely used in both research and industrial applications. However, ROS itself does not assure self-adaptive behavior. This paper introduces AC-ROS, which fills this gap by using assurance case models at run time to manage the self-adaptive operation of ROS-based systems. Assurance cases provide structured arguments that a system satisfies requirements and can be specified graphically with Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) models. AC-ROS uses GSN models to instantiate a ROS-based MAPE-K framework, which in turn uses these models at run time to assure system behavior adheres to requirements across adaptations. For this study, AC-ROS is implemented and tested on EvoRally, a 1:5-scale autonomous vehicle.",assurance case | cyber-physical systems | digital twin | goal structuring notation | robot operating system | self-adaptive systems,"Proceedings - 23rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS 2020",2020-10-16,Conference Paper,"Cheng, Betty H.C.;Clark, Robert Jared;Fleck, Jonathon Emil;Langford, Michael Austin;McKinley, Philip K.",Include,

Within a highway ecosystem, for example, autonomous vehicles could deploy smart agents in the form of software applications. This would enable cooperative driving and ultimately formation of vehicle platoons that reduce air friction and fuel consumption. In the smart grid domain, software-defined virtual power plants could be established to enable remote and autonomous collaboration of various units, such as smart meters, data concentrators, and distributed energy resources, in order to optimize power generation, demand-side energy and power storage. Effective collaboration within these emerging digital ecosystems strongly relies on the assumption that all components of the ecosystem operate as expected, and a level of trust among them is established based on that. In this paper, we present the idea of trust-based digital ecosystems, built upon the concept of a digital twin of this ecosystem, as a machine readable representation of the system and a representation of goals and trust at runtime. This creates demand for introducing a reference architecture for trust-based digital ecosystems that would capture their main concepts and relationships. By modeling the goals of the actors and systems, a reference architecture can provide a basis for analyzing competitive forces that influence the health of an ecosystem.",Automotive smart ecosystem | Collaborative embedded systems | Digital ecosystems | Reference architecture | Smart ecosystems | Smart grid | Software ecosystems,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2019-09-09,Conference Paper,"Cioroaica, Emilia;Chren, Stanislav;Buhnova, Barbora;Kuhn, Thomas;Dimitrov, Dimitar",Include,

The blinking of an LED can be induced on a virtual 3D model (digital twin) of the machine by a remote expert using a virtual reality application to draw the local worker’s attention to certain areas.

Prior to classification, the 3D point clouds are clustered using either Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) or k-means algorithms. We then use randomly sampled 3D point normal vectors as an entropy descriptor to calculate the direction and position of the virtual camera, which is placed around these clusters. It synthesizes 2D images of a given cluster from multiple views with positions and directions that have highest visual entropy. We then proceed to classify the images using a retrained CNN. We test our approach for classifying common office furniture items using both synthetic and actual 3D point clouds of typical indoor office spaces. The empirical results demonstrate that our approach is suited towards classifying specific indoor furniture objects.We also describe how our approach can be implemented as a lightweight component within a service-oriented system that is used for visualization and classification of 3D point clouds using a given Web3D tool.

All Rights Reserved.When wearing a head-mounted display (HMD) in everyday environments, interactions with real world bystanders often fail due to the visual barrier. As a result, the HMD user takes off the headset, which ends the virtual reality (VR) experience. We address this problem by providing a shared surface with the same content for both users, which is located at the same physical position in the real and the virtual world. In a between-subject user study (N = 40), we investigate the effects of a shared surface for short-term collaboration in co-located mixed-presence scenarios. We compare (a) real-world collaboration, (b) having a shared surface only and (c) combining the shared surface with an avatar representation of the real world user in VR. We could show that shared surfaces are helpful for mixed-presence collaboration. Adding an avatar in VR improves performance measures such as task-completion time, error rate and number of clarifying questions.

Publication rights licensed to ACM.Autopilot systems are typically composed of an “inner loop” providing stability and control, whereas an “outer loop” is responsible for mission-level objectives, such as way-point navigation. Autopilot systems for unmanned aerial vehicles are predominately implemented using Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control systems, which have demonstrated exceptional performance in stable environments. However, more sophisticated control is required to operate in unpredictable and harsh environments. Intelligent flight control systems is an active area of research addressing limitations of PID control most recently through the use of reinforcement learning (RL), which has had success in other applications, such as robotics. Yet previous work has focused primarily on using RL at the mission-level controller. In this work, we investigate the performance and accuracy of the inner control loop providing attitude control when using intelligent flight control systems trained with state-of-the-art RL algorithms-Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, Trust Region Policy Optimization, and Proximal Policy Optimization. To investigate these unknowns, we first developed an open source high-fidelity simulation environment to train a flight controller attitude control of a quadrotor through RL. We then used our environment to compare their performance to that of a PID controller to identify if using RL is appropriate in high-precision, time-critical flight control.",Adaptive control | Attitude control | Autopilot | Intelligent control | Machine learning | PID | Quadcopter | Reinforcement learning | UAV,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,2019-02-01,Article,"Koch, William;Mancuso, Renato;West, Richard;Bestavros, Azer",Include,

A way to achieve this is to decarbonize the electricity grid. However, further efforts must be made in other fields such as transport and heating for full decarbonization. This would reduce carbon emissions due to electricity generation, and also help to decarbonize other sources such as automotive and heating by enabling a low-carbon alternative. Carbon taxes have been shown to be an efficient way to aid in this transition. In this paper, we demonstrate how to to find optimal carbon tax policies through a genetic algorithm approach, using the electricity market agent-based model ElecSim. To achieve this, we use the NSGA-II genetic algorithm to minimize average electricity price and relative carbon intensity of the electricity mix. We demonstrate that it is possible to find a range of carbon taxes to suit differing objectives. Our results show that we are able to minimize electricity cost to below £10/MWh as well as carbon intensity to zero in every case. In terms of the optimal carbon tax strategy, we found that an increasing strategy between 2020 and 2035 was preferable. Each of the Pareto-front optimal tax strategies are at least above £81/tCO2 for every year.

Herein, the digital twin (DT) concept is regarded as a key technology to create value with smart services [2]. Although the research and applications of DTs emerge continuously many concerns are to be scrutinized [3]. The lack of a shared conceptual framework for DTs with an unambiguous terminology [4] complicates cross-functional discussions. Therefore, a systematization of the main dimensions of DTs is proposed in the form of an ontology and a conceptual framework thereof derived. The research questions addressed in this paper are a) «Which dimensions are used to classify and structure DTs in academic literature?», b) «What are the fundamental differences or specifications within these dimensions?» and c) «How do these different specifications relate to each other?» The focus of the research is on the objective to find classification systematics that are a) representing the entire spectrum of DTs, b) universally valid in all DT related domains and c) applicable in research and practice. A systematic literature review on the relevant aspects of DTs was conducted and the findings iteratively advanced within workshop sessions with academic experts. DTs are considered as integrators of physical and digital worlds as well as internal and external value creation. Further, the creation of DTs requires per definition the use of digital data. Hence, the proposed ontology and conceptual framework for DTs include the following main dimensions to consider for every DT: Data resources, external value creation and internal value creation. The main subdimensions of the data resources are the data sources to obtain the data, the data categories and the data formats. The main subdimension of the external value creation are the attributes of the services as the basis of the value propositions, the level of smartness of the connected products and the actors on the different levels of the ecosystem. The main subdimensions of the internal value creation are the lifecycle phases of products, the product management levels and the different generations of both. The proposed ontology and conceptual framework support researchers and practitioners in positioning and structuring their intended DT activities and communicating them to internal and external stakeholders. The holistic view on the data resource dimension further allows to easily deduct the needed data for certain applications or deduct possible applications from already available data.",conceptual framework | Digital Twin | ontology | systematization,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2020-03-19,Conference Paper,"Barth, Linard;Ehrat, Matthias;Fuchs, Rainer;Haarmann, Jens",Exclude,

In other words, DT systems are, to a large extent, IoT-intensive systems. Indeed, by exploiting and managing IoT data, artificial intelligence, and big data and simulation capabilities, DTs have emerged as a promising approach to manage the virtual manifestation of real-world entities throughout their entire lifecycle. Their proliferation will contribute to realizing the long-craved convergence of virtual and physical spaces to augment things and human capabilities. In this context, despite the proposal of noteworthy contributions, we argue that DTs have not been sufficiently investigated from a software engineering perspective. To address this, in this paper we propose GEMINIS, an architectural reference model that adopts self-adaptation, control, and model-driven engineering techniques to specify the structural and behavioural aspects of DTs and enable the evolution of their internal models. Moreover, we introduce an approach for engineering IoT-intensive Digital Twin Software Systems (DTSS) using GEMINIS' capabilities to deal with uncertain conditions that are inherent to the nature of mirrored physical environments and that might compromise the fidelity of a DT. With GEMINIS and the proposed approach, we aim to advance the engineering of DTSS as well as IoT and cyber-physical systems by providing practitioners with guidelines to model and specify inherent structural and behavioural characteristics of DTs, addressing common design concerns.",adaptive control | Digital twin | DTSS | dynamic context management | GEMINIS | IoT | megamodel | MIAC | models at runtime | MRAC | reference model | self-adaptive,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE/ACM 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering Workshops, ICSEW 2020",2020-06-27,Conference Paper,"Rivera, Luis F.;Müller, Hausi A.;Villegas, Norha M.;Tamura, Gabriel;Jiménez, Miguel",Include,

However, such systems are still bound to encounter situations that were not considered at design time. For reasons like safety, cost, or ethics it is often highly desired that these new cases be handled correctly upon first encounter. In this paper, we first justify our position that there will always exist unpredicted events and conditions, driven by, e.g., new inventions in the real world, the diversity of world-wide system deployments and uses, and the possibility that multiple events that were unforeseen at design time (or overlooked, or knowingly abandoned following cost-benefit-risk calculations) will not only occur, but will occur together. We then argue that despite the unpredictability, handling such situations is indeed possible. Hence, we offer and exemplify design principles, which, when applied in advance, can improve the system's ability to deal with unpredicted situations. We conclude with a discussion of how this work and a much-needed thorough study of the unexpected can contribute toward a foundation of engineering principles for developing trustworthy next-generation autonomous systems.",autonomous systems | robustness | software engineering | systems engineering | trustworthiness | unexpected events | unpredictable circumstances,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE/ACM 15th International Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems, SEAMS 2020",2020-06-29,Conference Paper,"Marron, Assaf;Limonad, Lior;Pollack, Sarah;Harel, David",Exclude,

Since lithium-ion batteries are perishable goods and underlie e. g. aging effects, environmental and operating conditions during manufacturing and car usage need close supervision. With regard to the paradigm of digital twins, data from various life cycle phases needs to be collected and processed to improve the general quality of the system. To achieve this complex task, a suitable framework is needed in order to operate the fleet of digital twins during manufacturing processes, the automotive usage and a potential second life. Based on a literature review, we formulate requirements for a digital twin framework in the field of battery systems. We propose a framework to develop and operate a fleet of digital twins during all life cycle phases. Results feature a case study in which we implement the stated framework in a cloud-computing environment using early stages of battery system production as test a bed.

This paper proposes a conceptual model for mitigating forest fire risk by use of self-adaptive and autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Memoryless property of exponential distribution is also reflected and considered in the calculations of forest fire probabilities. Stochastic and dynamic properties of the situation and the mathematical complexity of the routing problem entailed and justified a simulation study. The effectiveness of the proposed dispatching approach for routing UAVs and the validity of the proposed model are tested on a small sized realistic scenario.

In most cases, effectiveness of the design is limited to expertise of the respective designer, which also results in inefficient and incomplete exploration of the product's design space. With a large amount of data available and recent advancements in hardware technology, data-driven methods have become an increasingly common strategy for problems that are difficult to formulate or expensive to solve by creating a physical model, but such methods often lack the application perspective; they are not yet widely applied especially in engineering product development. Generative design (here, more precisely generative engineering) is one such technique which has recently gained importance. Although many preliminary studies demonstrate plausible results from data-driven generative design approaches, a closeloop-3D-generative-design-pipeline that achieves full automation and optimization of the design with respect to the product's functional requirements is still in its nascent stage. This paper proposes a generalized hybrid framework comprised of both data-based and physics-based methods to achieve this objective, as represented by the teaser figure 1.

I n t h is s t udy, we propose a fog computing based framework to assist autonomous driving. Our framework relies on overhead views from cameras and data streams from vehicle sensors to create a network of distributed digital twins, called an edge twin, on fog machines. The edge twin will be continuously updated with the locations of both autonomous and human-piloted vehicles on the road segments. The vehicle locations will be harvested from overhead cameras as well as location feeds from the vehicles themselves. Although the edge twin can make fair road space allocations from a global viewpoint, there is a communication cost (delay) in reaching it from the cameras and vehicular sensors. To address this, we introduce a machine learning forecaster as a part of the edge twin which is responsible for predicting the future location of vehicles. Lastly, we introduce a box algorithm that will use the forecasted values to create a hazard map for the road segment which would be used by the framework to suggest safe manoeuvres for the autonomous vehicles such as lane changes and accelerations.

Given a natural language description, code retrieval aims to search for the most relevant code relevant among a set of code snippets. Existing state-of-the-art approaches apply neural networks to code retrieval. However, these approaches still fail to capture an important feature: overlaps. The overlaps between different names used by different people indicate that two different names may be potentially related (e.g., 'message' and 'msg'), and the overlaps between identifiers in code and words in natural language descriptions indicate that the code snippet and the description may potentially be related. To address this problem, we propose a novel neural architecture named OCoR, where we introduce two specifically-designed components to capture overlaps: the first embeds names by characters to capture the overlaps between names, and the second introduces a novel overlap matrix to represent the degrees of overlaps between each natural language word and each identifier. The evaluation was conducted on two established datasets. The experimental results show that OCoR significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches and achieves 13.1% to 22.3% improvements.

Having a cloud-based and platformindependent system that can interpret Big Data in real-time and represent the processed information in a user-friendly manner offers the opportunity not only for improving fault diagnosis and troubleshooting automation, but also offering a better representation of data for operators, technicians and engineers. This not only decreases the repair costs by enabling constant components' state of health awareness, but also increases the efficacy of the apparatus by lowering the downtimes due to faults and issues. In this paper (WindTwin), we propose a real-time, interactive and dynamic 3-D neural-network model that provides important information of a small-scale wind turbine (WT) machinery setup including the state of health of different components (bearings, shafts) based on monitoring sensors (vibrations and temperature) and operations conditions (rotation speed).

There is an increasing demand to create digital twins as representation of cyber-physical systems and their related models, data traces, aggregated data, and services. Despite a plethora of digital twin applications, there are very few systematic methods to facilitate the modeling of digital twins for a given cyber-physical system. Existing methods focus only on the construction of specific digital twin models and do not consider the integration of these models with the observed cyber-physical system. To mitigate this, we present a fully model-driven method to describe the software of the cyber-physical system, its digital twin information system, and their integration. The integration method relies on MontiArc models of the cyber-physical system's architecture and on UML/P class diagrams from which the digital twin information system is generated.

Automatic Building detection and Energy Model creation (AutoBEM) has created 178,368 building energy models for the Electric Power Board (EPB) of Chattanooga, TN, and compared simulation performance to 15-minute data from each building. These models leverage several data sources (e.g. imagery, GIS, utility), software tools to extract building properties (e.g. footprint, height, façade type, window-to-wall ratio, occupancy, building type), simulate at scale on two of the world's #1 fastest supercomputers, and provide web-based visual analytics. Grid-interactive efficient buildings offer the potential to reduce utility and rate-payer energy costs during each calendar month's hour of critical generation - when the least efficient, most costly, and often dirtiest generation assets must be brought online. In this paper, EnergyPlus is used to simulate over 150,000 buildings to assess the technical potential of utility-controlled smart thermostats. This is analyzed under a couple scenarios leveraging buildings as thermal batteries via pre-conditioning to coast through peak hours. Results are provided in box and whisker plots assessing the distribution of peak demand reduction at the utility-scale along with breakouts of energy and demand savings by building type and vintage.",Peak demand reduction | Smart thermostats | Urban scale building energy modeling,"UrbSys 2019 - Proceedings of the 1st ACM International Workshop on Urban Building Energy Sensing, Controls, Big Data Analysis, and Visualization, Part of BuildSys 2019",2019-11-13,Conference Paper,"Bass, Brett;New, Joshua",Exclude,

Effective track anomaly detection should be based on the current road network structure. However, the indoor environment usually contains many obstacles flexible to move. The changes in the positions of obstacles frequently cause the changes of the road network structure. When the road network changes, it takes time and effort to manually redraw the road network and simultaneously losses the guarantee of real-time performance. At the same time, manual drawing is forbidden in some confidential places. In our paper, the scheme of RFID track anomaly detection combined with digital-twin technology is proposed to provide a real-time actual road network for anomaly analysis. The accurate mapping and virtual simulation functions of digital-twin technology are used to achieve the dynamic real-time rendering and the maintenance of the indoor road network structure. We also improve a clustering algorithm to make it suitable for indoor RFID track clustering. In our paper, deviation thresholds and digital-twin model are used to detect anomalies. The trajectory is judged to be abnormal when it appears in the restricted areas or exceeds the deviation thresholds in any terms of position, velocity, or direction. We use an improved scan-line algorithm and F1-scores to determine the threshold values. Our proposed anomaly detection method provides more effective and intuitive results for researchers to analyze.",Anomaly detection | Clustering | Digital-twin | RFID trajectory,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2019-11-12,Conference Paper,"Cai, Mengnan;Wang, Siye;Shen, Xinling;Jin, Yijia",Include,

This is grounded in New Materialism’s picture of a world understood through entanglement, through resonant constellations, through a multiplicity of unique individual viewpoints and their relationships. These perspectives are especially relevant for design ethnography, in particular for research around smart connected products, which collect data about their environment, the networks they are a part of, and the ways they are used. However, we are concerned about the current trend of many connected systems towards surveillance capitalism, as data is colonised, machinations are hidden, and a narrow definition of value is extracted. There is a key tension that while design, particularly of networked objects, attempts to go beyond human centeredness, the infrastructures that support it are moving towards a less than human perspective in their race to accumulate and dispossess. Our work tries to imagine the situations where participants in networked systems are richly engaged, rather than exploited. We hope for a future where human agency is central to a respectful and acceptable collaborative development of understanding.",Biography of artefacts | Ethics | Ethnography | Ethnomining | Object oriented ontology | Surveillance capitalism | Thing ethnography | Third wave HCI,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,2019-11-19,Conference Paper,"Murray-Rust, Dave;Gorkovenko, Katerina;Burnett, Dan;Richards, Daniel",Exclude,

The health data that is, thus, becoming available represents a valuable source for continuous health monitoring and prevention, and clinical decision making. Detecting diseases at early stage can help to overcome and treat them accurately. Social media data can be used to understand, in near real time, human life dynamics worldwide. These massive quantities of data could support in a wide range of medical and healthcare applications, including among others clinical trials and decision support. A Clinical Decision Support System (CDS) can greatly help in identifying diseases and methods of treatment. In this paper we propose a CDS framework that can integrate heterogeneous health data from different sources, such as laboratory test results, basic information of patients, health records and social media data.

Digital twins are useful because they provide models and data for design, production, operation, diagnostics, and prognostics of machines and products. Traditionally, building a digital twin requires many built-in sensors to monitor various physical phenomena associated with cyber-physical systems such as vibration, energy consumption, etc. However, many legacy manufacturing systems do not have multi-physics sensors built-in by default. Moreover, it might not be feasible to intrusively place sensors in these systems after they are manufactured. To bring the advantages of digitalization to legacy manufacturing systems, this paper contributes with an Internet-of-Things (IoT) based methodology to build digital twins using an indirect medium such as side-channels, which can localize anomalous faults and infer the quality of the products being manufactured while keeping itself up-to-date. We achieve this by exploring and utilizing the side-channels (emissions such as acoustics, power, magnetic, etc.) of the system that unintentionally reveal the cyber and physical state of the system. To validate our methodology, in this paper, we focus on building a digital twin model of a Fused-Deposition Modeling (FDM) based Cartesian additive manufacturing system. The proposed methodology achieves 83.09% accuracy in anomaly localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the possibility of modeling and maintaining a living digital twin of a manufacturing system by extracting information from the side-channels using low-end IoT sensors.",digital twin | internet-of-things | machine learning | smart manufacturing,IoTDI 2019 - Proceedings of the 2019 Internet of Things Design and Implementation,2019-04-15,Conference Paper,"Chhetri, Sujit Rokka;Faezi, Sina;Canedo, Arquimedes;Faruque, Mohammad Abdullah Al",Include,

However, most of these are fundamentally dissociated from the spatial nature of buildings as they exist in isolation from the building system and other smart devices in the same space. This situation results in user interaction experiences that are convoluted and non-intuitive, negatively affecting their adoption. Meanwhile, Building Information Models, while used extensively in a building’s design and construction phases, remains underutilized in its operation phase. This paper proposes BIM as an “operating system” for smart homes to serve as the foundational platform for smart device applications. Much like the analogous operating system for computers, BIM serves to provide IoT enabled devices access to information and control over various components of the built environment. It is expected that this smart home architecture would enable seamless integration of smart home functionality across devices and buildings to provide residents with contextualized information for optimized security, comfort, and efficiency. Methods for personalizing building performance to users can also be accomplished through the proposed methodology.",BIM | Internet of Things (IoT) | Smart devices | User experience,"Proceedings of the Human-Habitat for Health (H3): Human-Habitat Multimodal Interaction for Promoting Health and Well-Being in the Internet of Things era - 20th ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction, ICMI 2018",2018-10-16,Conference Paper,"Louis, Joseph;Rashid, Khandakar",Exclude,

Such system controls an underlying factory interacting with sensors, actuators and other systems creating systems-of-systems. A main point of interest is how these components are built and interconnected, i.e. the system's architecture, and how it might be improved to increase reliability and security. Aims: Unfortunately, there is no review available describing and identifying recent research status and progress for such architectures. Thus, in this systematic mapping study, we overview research on architecture for CPS in the context of Industry 4.0. Method: With an initial automatic search and through iterative refining, first results were gathered. Next, forward and backwards snowballing was performed to integrate the results, giving a final population of 213 papers. The output of this study is firstly a categorization and plot of architectural styles. Secondly, the categorization is extended to include security concerns. Results: In general, there is a tendency in proposing solutions in the fields of system and software architecture while other areas are visibly under-researched. Most proposals focus in digital representation, information management and integration of solutions. Conclusions: While a lot of solution proposals for different architectures exist, there are many fields uncovered and most of the solutions still lack of validation and evaluation results.

In this context, ML can be used as a computer network modeling technique to build models that estimate the network performance. Indeed, network modeling is a central technique to many networking functions, for instance in the field of optimization, in which the model is used to search a configuration that satisfies the target policy. In this paper, we aim to provide an answer to the following question: Can neural networks accurately model the delay of a computer network as a function of the input traffic? For this, we assume the network as a black-box that has as input a traffic matrix and as output delays. Then we train different neural networks models and evaluate its accuracy under different fundamental network characteristics: topology, size, traffic intensity and routing. With this, we aim to have a better understanding of computer network modeling with neural nets and ultimately provide practical guidelines on how such models need to be trained.",KDN | ML | Modeling | Networking | SDN,"Big-DAMA 2018 - Proceedings of the 2018 Workshop on Big Data Analytics and Machine Learning for Data Communication Networks, Part of SIGCOMM 2018",2018-08-07,Conference Paper,"Mestres, Albert;Alarcón, Eduard;Ji, Yusheng;Cabellos-Aparicio, Albert",Exclude,

In this paper, we discuss a set of scenarios for access control needed in current and future systems and use that to argue that an approach for resources to generate and manage their access control policies dynamically on their own is needed.

A critical challenge for IoT systems is to ensure continuous provisioning of IoT services by overcoming network breakdowns, hardware failures, and energy constraints. To overcome these issues, we propose a cloud-based framework namely SensorClone, which relies on virtual devices to improve IoT resilience. A virtual device is the digital counterpart of a physical device that has learned to emulate its operations from sample data collected from the physical one. SensorClone exploits the collected data of low-power devices to create virtual devices in the cloud. SensorClone then can opportunistically migrate virtual devices from the cloud into other devices, potentially underutilized, with higher capabilities and closer to the edge of the network, e.g., smart devices. Through a real deployment of our SensorClone in the wild, we identify that virtual devices can be used for two purposes, 1) to reduce the energy consumption of physical devices by duty cycling their service provisioning between the physical device and the virtual representation hosted in the cloud, and 2) to scale IoT services at the edge of the network by harnessing temporal periods of underutilization of smart devices. To evaluate our framework, we present a use case of a virtual sensor created from an IoT service of temperature. From our results, we verify that it is possible to achieve unlimited availability up to 90% and substantial power efficiency under acceptable levels of quality of service. Our work makes contributions towards improving IoT scalability and resilience by using virtual devices.",Cloud computing | Edge Computing | Internet of Things | Opportunistic Migration | Resilience | Virtual Sensor,"Proceedings of the 9th ACM Multimedia Systems Conference, MMSys 2018",2018-06-12,Conference Paper,"Flores, Huber;Hui, Pan;Tarkoma, Sasu;Li, Yong;Anagnostopoulos, Theodoros;Kostakos, Vassilis;Luo, Chu;Su, Xiang",Exclude,

What contribution S-BPM can make in the future of digital process management is analyzed in this paper aiming at the anniversary conference of S-BPM. As basis for the analysis serves the idea that, the suitability of BPM concepts (such as S-BPM) for certain application domains depends on essential process properties. Based on an assessment model we analyze under what conditions subject orientation can be well used (e.g., focus on collaboration). Using these results, we are evaluating the opportunities of S-BPM for the digital future. The evaluation is based on the three exemplary trends (i) digital development/products, (ii) digital production and (iii) digital business transformation. In these trend, we asses which conditions change (e.g. fast changing environments, machine-To-machine-communication, user-centered thinking) and to what degree S-BPM can still contribute in the new digital world.

The eXtended Discrete Element Method (XDEM) framework, developed at the LuXDEM Research Centre of the University of Luxembourg, extends DEM by including the thermochemical state of particles, as well as their interaction with a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) domain. The level of detail of its predictions makes the XDEM suite a powerful tool for predicting complex industrial processes like steel making, powder metallurgy and additive manufacturing. Like in any other DEM software, the critical aspect of the simulations is the computation requirement that grows rapidly as the number of particles increases. Indeed, such burden currently represents the main bottleneck to its full exploitation in large-scale scenarios. Digital Twin, a research project founded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), aims at drastically accelerate XDEM through different approaches and make it an effective tool for numerical predictions in industry as well as virtual prototyping. The Multiphase Particle-In-Cell (MP-PIC) method has been introduced for reducing the computation burden of DEM. It has been initially developed for predicting particles flow and uses a two-way transfer of information between the Lagrangian entities and a computation grid. The method avoids explicit contact detection and can potentially achieve a drastic reduction of the time-to-solution respect to DEM. The present contribution introduces a multiphase approach for predicting the conductive heat transfer within a static packed bed of particles. Results from a test case are qualitatively and quantitatively compared against reference XDEM predictions.

A DT is a digital representation of a real-world physical component, product, or equipment. A DT can be used for 3-D design, testing, simulation, and prototyping prior to the manufacturing of the physical component. Once a physical component is in operation, a DT can be used for configuration, monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics. It is expected that DTs will gain significant attention in the foreseeable future, and will play a key role in Industry 4.0. However, today's approaches, systems, and technologies leveraged for the creation of DTs are mostly centralized and fall short of providing trusted data provenance, audit, and traceability. Also, data related to transactions, logs, and history are not secure or tamper-proof. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based creation process of DTs to guarantee secure and trusted traceability, accessibility, and immutability of transactions, logs, and data provenance. Our proposed approach uses smart contracts to govern and track transactions initiated by participants involved in the creation of DTs. Our approach also employs decentralized storage of interplanetary file systems to store and share DTs data. Moreover, we present details on our system design and architecture, implementation, and algorithms. Furthermore, we provide security and cost analysis, and show how our approach fulfills the requirements of DTs process creation. We make the smart contract code for creating DTs publicly available on Github.",blockchain | Digital twins | Ethereum | Industry 4.0 | security | smart contracts,IEEE Access,2020-01-01,Article,"Hasan, Haya R.;Salah, Khaled;Jayaraman, Raja;Omar, Mohammed;Yaqoob, Ibrar;Pesic, Sasa;Taylor, Todd;Boscovic, Dragan",Exclude,

The goal of the transparent DT-BRB is not only to model the complex relationships between the system inputs and output but also to conduct output control by identifying and optimizing the key parameters in the model inputs. The proposed DT-BRB approach is composed of three major steps. First, BRB is adopted to model the relationships between the inputs and output of the physical system. Second, an analytical procedure is proposed to identify only the key parameters in the system inputs with the highest contribution to the output. Being consistent with the inferencing, integration, and unification procedures of BRB, there are also three parts in the contribution calculation in this step. Finally, the data-driven optimization is performed to control the system output. A practical case study on the Wuhan Metro System is conducted for reducing the building tilt rate (BTR) in tunnel construction. By comparing the results following different standards, the 80% contribution standard is proved to have the highest marginal contribution that identifies only 43.5% parameters as the key parameters but can reduce the BTR by 73.73%. Moreover, it is also observed that the proposed DT-BRB approach is so effective that iterative optimizations are not necessarily needed.",Belief rule base (BRB) | building tilt rate (BTR) | output control | transparent digital twin (DT),IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,2022-10-01,Article,"Chang, Leilei;Zhang, Limao;Fu, Chao;Chen, Yu Wang",Exclude,

A skillful reaction of simulated robots to unpredicted contact forces has become an especially stringent necessity to support the development of emerging applications for which a compliant robotic manipulation is indispensable. This paper focuses on the simulation of physics-based virtual testbeds in which simulated robots are made capable of accommodating external forces exerted by the environment on their manipulators. For this, we integrate methods from multi-body dynamics modeling, advanced robotics, and virtual reality to develop a robotics simulation basis that facilitates the employment of compliant robotic manipulations in simulated applications. The validation of this basis in joint space indicates that a physics-based simulation of robots endowed with active physical interaction control can capture and reflect significant effects which characterize the interactive behavior of physical compliant robots.We demonstrate the practical utility of our approach to unlock competitive advantages in fully simulated applications prone to position uncertainty.

Digital twins further increase a product's value, making it critical to secure the link between the physical and digital world. An entire industry has sprung up to address this problem with a wide variety of product-authentication technologies, or crypto anchors, offering many different trade-offs between supported product surface, security level, price sensitivity, ease of use, etc. Each crypto-anchor vendor provides their own APIs for commissioning, verification and monitoring which makes it hard for application developers to support many of them.

The platform is composed of simulation system, physical UAV and service center, which is designed to solve the problem about UAV advanced capability training and algorithm verification. As we know, a good UAV system verification method is to make full use of virtual simulation before repeated physical tests. However, there is a gap between the virtual simulation and physical test results, because the simulation model is difficult to completely describe the actual physical object. So the hidden risks may exist in actual physical tests by only using the results of virtual simulations. Based on the feedback control idea, the actual state data of the physical UAV is fed back to virtual simulation platform, and the virtual simulation platform completes virtual and real joint training and verification based on this. That is, the technology of digital twin is introduced into the UAV system development process in this paper. In addition, the digital twin platform structure of two-way interaction between virtual space, physical space and service center is proposed.

However, this equipment is quite expensive which forces some institutions to seek other alternatives or forego them altogether. In addition, online courses tend to be light on hardware because of the practical and technical challenges associated with running remote hardware-based laboratories. Therefore, a system is needed that allows students who are enrolled in remote courses to experience hardware-intensive classes just as they would an in-person course (especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic). In this work, use virtual and augmented reality to build and test a remote UR-10 robotics lab that allows students to work together on a hands-on robotics-based lab. In the future, we plan to demonstrate its technical and pedagogical suitability by running a user study in a real-world class whereby remote students enrolled in a course will participate in a series of experiments to control a UR-10 robot arm. It opens up avenues to explore the advantages and shortcomings of running coordinated group lab exercises between students from different institutions, time-zones, and continents by time-decoupling the schedules.

In order to meet these demands, the digital twin is a very suitable technology. The digital twins could understand the state of the physical entities through physical models, sensing data and the big data generated from the product lifecycle, so as to predict, estimate, and analyze the dynamic changes. The digital twin is mainly composed of the information data, data exchange interface and digital model. The information data is obtained from the equipment production, operation and management process, including equipment production information and CAD model, environmental information, pre-test and maintenance data, online monitoring data and various sensor measurement data. It provides a comprehensive description of the actual equipment. The data exchange interface is a standardized information transmission channel, which ensures timely and efficient data transmission at various time periods throughout the life cycle of the equipment. The digital model acquires the date through the date exchange interface, structurally stores the data, establishes a virtual model corresponding to the equipment. In order to build up the digital twin, two main problems should be solved. One is the acquisition and storage of the data, the other is the responding speed of the digital model. In the current equipment management system, the various information data of the equipment entire life cycle are independent of each other, and the data utilization efficiency is quite low. Thus, we put forward the life cycle digital thread for the electrical equipment. It contains not only the data of design, production, installation and operation, but also the virials sensing data, environment date and historical experience data of similar equipment. To solve the problem of the responding speed, the preparatory simulation model has been put forward. In this model, a series of the equipment statues are simulated forward and the results are stored in the digital twin. Based on these simulation results and the simplified physical model, the relationship of the sensing data and the equipment state is build. Then, the relationship is revised and optimized through experiment to make sure of the accuracy of the model. This paper studies the data modelling methods and applies the 'digital twin' to the electrical equipment. It is of great significance for the development of intelligent electrical equipment.",Digital Twin | Life Cycle | Preparatory Simulation Model | State Evaluation,"7th IEEE International Conference on High Voltage Engineering and Application, ICHVE 2020 - Proceedings",2020-09-06,Conference Paper,"Zhang, Shuai;Wang, Song;Zhao, Linjie",Exclude,

The AFDX standard, a major innovation in aircraft technology, first used with the Airbus A380, introduces telecom Ethernet-based technology, as well as a switch connection topology, rather than part-to-part links or buses. Airbus and CES partnered to develop a general-purpose building block, which allows the simulation, test or connection of any AFDX connected equipment. Integrated into different packages, ranging from the small equipment tester, through the complete aircraft integration test bench, up to the full flight test computer.

The information sharing is done locally through measurement but globally by adopting a protocol over the communication network for fast and reliable information exchange for microgrid protection and coordination among the devices present in the power network. In this article, a real-time simulation of a smart microgrid with the emulation of the intelligent electronic devices present in the grid that takes action over the events is proposed using the hardware-in-the-loop methodology. The information exchange between the simulated microgrid and the emulated intelligent trip unit of the circuit breaker is adopted using a physical communication network and User datagram protocol over Ethernet. The unique aspect is to approach the problem of co-simulating the power system simulator with the communication network without platform dependencies to obtain more realistic results. The mathematical models are created using model-based design approach with which a C code can be generated and can be simulated in real-time with any of the digital twins available.

Researchers have developed many HIL test systems for power systems in recent years. Those test systems can model both microsecond-level dynamic responses of power electronic systems and millisecond-level transients of transmission and distribution grids. By integrating individual HIL test systems into a network of HIL test systems, we can create large-scale power grid digital twins with flexible structures at required modeling resolution that fits for a wide range of system operating conditions.

To achieve a faster response to problems, it is essential to increase the speed of DE simulations because making optimal decisions for addressing the issues requires repeated simulations. This paper presents a hierarchical aggregation/disaggregation (A/D) method that substitutes complex event-driven operations with two-layered abstracted models-single-group mean-delay models (SMDMs) and multi-group MDMs (MMDMs)-to gain simulation speedup. The SMDM dynamically abstracts a DE machine group's behaviors into observed mean-delay constants when the group converges into a steady state. The MMDM fast-forwards the input lots by bypassing the chained processing steps in multiple steady-state groups until it schedules the lots for delivery to subsequent unsteady groups after corresponding multi-step mean delays. The key component, the abstraction-level converter (ALC), has the roles of MMDM allocation, deallocation, extension, splitting, and controls the flow of each group's input lot by deciding the destination DE model, SMDM, and MMDMs. To maximize the reuse of previously computed multi-step delays for the dynamically changing MMDMs, we propose an efficient method to manage the delays using two-level caches. Each steady-state group's ALC performs statistical testing to detect the lot-arrival change to reactivate the DE model. However, fast-forwarding (FF) results in incorrect test results of the bypassed group's ALCs due to the missed observations of the bypassed lots. Thus, we propose a method for test-sample reinitialization that considers the bypassing. Moreover, since a bypassed group's unexpected divergence can change the multi-step delays of previously scheduled events, a method for examination of FF history is designed to trace the highly influenced events. This proposed method has been applied in various case studies, and it has achieved speedups of up to about 5.9 times, with 2.5 to 8.3% degradation in accuracy.",Abstraction-level conversion | aggregation/disaggregation | discrete-event modeling | smart manufacturing | wafer fabrication,IEEE Access,2021-01-01,Article,"Seok, Moon Gi;Cai, Wentong;Park, Daejin",Exclude,

To accurately reflect the condition of the engine, this article provides a novel fault diagnosis method for the TFE-731 turbofan engine and develops an online diagnosis system. With the combinations of model-based and data-driven approaches, models are constructed to create the so-called digital twins of the engine parameters. For the model-based approach, the physical isentropic compression is used as the basis of the model. For the data-driven approach, the fast orthogonal search is utilized to ensure that the model outputs close to the real engine data. Based on the model prediction-based monitoring strategy, the status of the engine can be identified online. By using the proposed method, an alarm will be triggered once the tested engine outputs cross the boundaries generated by the digital twins. This method can be further applied in quality control to examine the abnormal parts of an aircraft engine. Finally, the digital twins' online diagnosis system is realized in the practical TFE-731 test facility, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method.",Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model | fast orthogonal search (FOS) | fault diagnosis | turbofan engine modeling,IEEE Systems Journal,2022-06-01,Article,"Peng, Chao Chung;Chen, Yi Ho",Include,

In the domain of high-power converters, which rely on the use of digital controllers while switching at frequencies not exceeding several kHz, Hardware-In-The-Loop (HIL) systems have become widely adopted for commissioning and testing of control software. To put it differently, analog simulators or scaled-down versions of the same highpower converters have been replaced with HIL systems lately. Owing to the availability of computational power, HIL systems provide the means for high-fidelity real time simulations of the converter hardware parts. Connecting the dedicated controller, supposed to govern the hardware parts, to the Real-Time Simulator (RTS), through a suitable interface, gives control engineers the possibility to explore performances of various control algorithms without the controller ever realizing it drives the converter model, running on the employed RTS, instead of the real power hardware. Consequently, a risk-free environment for development and testing of control schemes is ensured, which is crucial especially if large and expensive systems, such as MW level power electronics converters, are considered.

The concept of Digital Twin (DT) has recently emerged as one of the approaches to achieve the objective of resilience. In the approach using DT, a software-based live model of a target CPS is used to continuously monitor, surveil and verify the correctness of the target CPS operation. In this paper, we empirically study the effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based models as the basis of DT-based resilience. We uncover the important characteristics of an RNN-based solution with experimentation on a lab-scale Canal Lock CPS emulator with live validations and attack scenarios. For the first time, we demonstrate actual, real-time use of a RNN-based model as a DT for performing live analysis on an operational CPS. Based on the observed results, we highlight the importance of a DT model's training interval, prediction interval and CPS polling interval in the process of anomaly detection. We uncover the limitations in anomaly detection due to real-time synchronization needs of the RNN-based DT. We highlight this uncovered tug of war between synchronization and anomaly detection is inherent in any complex CPS that is monitored and synchronized by relying on the same sensor streams of ground truth for both synchronization as well as anomaly detection.",CPS cyber security | CPS live modeling | RNN based Digital Twin,"Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Industrial Internet Cloud, ICII 2019",2019-11-01,Conference Paper,"Yoginath, Srikanth;Tansakul, Varisara;Chinthavali, Supriya;Taylor, Curtis;Hambrick, Joshua;Irminger, Philip;Perumalla, Kalyan",Include,

This task is not easy due to the specific characteristics of such systems, and the natural resistance of Critical Infrastructures operators against actions implying downtime. Digital Twins, as accurate virtual models of physical objects or processes, can provide a faithful environment for security analysis or evaluation of potential mitigation strategies to be deployed in face of specific situations. Nonetheless, their on-premises deployment can be expensive, implying a significant CAPEX whose return will depend on the ability to plan and deploy a suitable support infrastructure, as well as implementing efficient and scalable data collection and processing mechanisms capable of taking advantage of the acquired resources. This paper presents an off-premises approach to design and deploy Digital Twins to secure critical infrastructures, developed in the scope of the ELEGANT project. Such Digital Twins are built using real-time, high fidelity replicas of Programming Logic Controllers, coupled with scalable and efficient data collection processes, supporting the development and validation of Machine Learning models to mitigate security threats like Denial of Service attacks. The validation approach of ELEGANT, which leveraged from the capabilities of the Fed4Fire federated testbeds evaluated the feasibility of using cloudified Digital Twins, thus converting a significant part of the projected CAPEX for the in-premises model into on-demand, pay-as-you-go OPEX, eventually paving the way for the establishment of a DTaaS (Digital Twin as a Service) paradigm. The achieved results demonstrate that the data pipelines providing support for the ELEGANT Digital Twins have low impact in terms of resource usage in Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service attack scenarios, when higher volumes of data are generated.",Digital Twins | DTaaS | pipelines | programmable logic controllers | SCADA | security,IEEE Access,2021-01-01,Article,"Sousa, Bruno;Arieiro, Miguel;Pereira, Vasco;Correia, Joao;Lourenco, Nuno;Cruz, Tiago",Include,

In this article, we investigate and discuss the use of the digital twin concept of the roads as a step toward realizing the dream of smart cities. To this end, we propose the deployment of a Digital Twin Box to the roads that is composed of a 360° camera and a set of IoT devices connected to a Single Onboard Computer. The Digital Twin Box creates a digital twin of the physical road asset by constantly sending real-time data to the edge/cloud, including the 360° live stream, GPS location, and measurements of the temperature and humidity. This data will be used for realtime monitoring and other purposes by displaying the live stream via head-mounted devices or using a 360° web-based player. Additionally, we perform an object detection process to extract all possible objects from the captured stream. For some specific objects (person and vehicle), an identification module and a tracking module are employed to identify the corresponding objects and keep track of all video frames where these objects appeared. The outcome of the latter step would be of utmost importance to many other services and domains such as national security.

Recently, power converters with grid-forming capabilities have attracted interest from researchers and utilities as keystone devices enabling modern microgrid architectures. Therefore, proper and thorough testing of Grid-Forming Inverters (GFMIs) is crucial to understand their dynamics and limitations before they are deployed. The use of closed-loop real-time Power Hardware-in-the-Loop (PHIL) simulations will facilitate the testing of GFMIs using a digital twin of the power system under various contingency scenarios within a controlled environment. So far, lower to medium scale commercially available GFMIs are difficult to interface into PHIL simulations because of their lack of a synchronization mechanism that allows a smooth and stable interconnection with a voltage source such as a power amplifier. Under this scenario, the use of the well-known Ideal Transformer Method to create a PHIL setup can lead to catastrophic damages of the GFMI. This paper addresses a simple but novel method to interface commercially available GFMIs into a PHIL testbed. Experimental results showed that the proposed method is stable and accurate under standalone operation with abrupt (step) load-changing dynamics, followed by the corresponding steady state behavior. Such results were validated against the dynamics of the GFMI connected to a linear load bank.",Grid-forming inverters | microgrids models | power-hardware-in-the-loop | simulation models,Conference Record of the IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference,2020-06-14,Conference Paper,"Hernandez-Alvidrez, Javier;Gurule, Nicholas S.;Reno, Matthew J.;Flicker, Jack D.;Summers, Adam;Ellis, Abraham",Include,

This has realized the need for artificial intelligence tools for robust data processing. However, the large size of input data requires real time monitoring and synchronization for online analysis. As the star concept behind the Industry 4.0 wave, a digital twin is a virtual, multi-scale and probabilistic simulation to mirror the performance of its physical counterpart and serve the product lifecycle in a virtual space. Evidently, a digital twin can proactively identify potential issues with its corresponding real twin. Thus, it is best suited for enabling a physics-based and data-driven model fusion to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of the components. Traditional RUL prediction approaches have assumed either an exponential or linear degradation trend with a fixed curve shape to build a Health Index (HI) model. Such an assumption may not be useful for multi-sensor systems or cases where sensor data is available intermittently. A common constraint in the industry is irregular sensor data collection. The resulting asynchronous time series of the sporadic data needs to be an accurate representation of the component's HI when constructing a degradation model. In this paper, we extend the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) technique to generate RUL prediction within a digital twin framework as a means of synchronization with changing operational states. More specifically, we first use LSTM encoder-decoder (LSTM-ED) to train a multilayered neural network and reconstruct the sensor data time series corresponding to a healthy state. The resulting reconstruction error can be used to capture patterns in input data time series and estimate HI of training and testing sets. Using a time lag to record similarity between the HI curves, a weighted average of the final RUL estimation is obtained. The described empirical approach is evaluated on publicly available engine degradation dataset with run-to-failure information. Results indicate a high RUL estimation accuracy with greater error reduction rate. This demonstrates wide applicability of the discussed methodology to various industries where event data is scarce for the application of only data-driven techniques.",Autoencoder | Deep Learning | IIoT | Long-short Term Memory | Prognostics | RUL Estimation,Proceedings - Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium,2020-01-01,Conference Paper,"Anis, Mohamad Danish;Taghipour, Sharareh;Lee, Chi Guhn",Exclude,

Developing a reliable and robust digital replica of the physical systems of the value chain is one of the most advanced (and challenging) approaches to digitalization, condensed in the concept of Digital Twin (DT). DT plays a fundamental role in creating a data-rich environment where simulation and optimization procedures can be run. With DT expected to become a commodity in the coming years, simulation and optimization become therefore a more accessible instrument for the improvement of manufacturing and business processes also in small enterprises with limited investment capacity. While scientific literature has analysed the adoption of DT in the optimization of products lifecycle, no contributions have yet focused on the exploitation of DT to improve the sustainability performances of whole value chains. In this paper we propose a reference framework where DTs built upon process and system data gathered from the field, allow to quickly assess the sustainability performances of both existing and planned production mixes and to compare achievable impacts with changing processes and technologies, thus enabling advisory features for sustainability-aware decision making in structured, multi-entity value networks.

Ever-increasing system design complexity also increased the necessity for more stringent testing and integration capabilities of these new topologies. Real-time simulators can be very useful tools to test, validate and integrate these complex devices. Maintenance and subsystem upgrades, common issues in such complex systems, cannot be easily done on the real systems, especially on larger systems like those in navy ships.

This human-robot interaction (HRI) working style helps to enhance human users' operational productivity and comfort; while data-driven welder behavior analysis benefits to further novice welder training. This HRI system includes three modules: 1) a human user who demonstrates the welding operations offsite with her/his operations recorded by the motion-tracked handles; 2) a robot that executes the demonstrated welding operations to complete the physical welding tasks onsite; 3) a DT system that is developed based on virtual reality (VR) as a digital replica of the physical human-robot interactive welding environment. The DT system bridges a human user and robot through a bi-directional information flow: a) transmitting demonstrated welding operations in VR to the robot in the physical environment; b) displaying the physical welding scenes to human users in VR. Compared to existing DT systems reported in the literatures, the developed one provides better capability in engaging human users in interacting with welding scenes, through an augmented VR. To verify the effectiveness, six welders, skilled with certain manual welding training and unskilled without any training, tested the system by completing the same welding job; three skilled welders produce satisfied welded workpieces, while the other three unskilled do not. A data-driven approach as a combination of fast Fourier transform (FFT), principal component analysis (PCA), and support vector machine (SVM) is developed to analyze their behaviors. Given an operation sequence, i.e., motion speed sequence of the welding torch, frequency features are firstly extracted by FFT and then reduced in dimension through PCA, which are finally routed into SVM for classification. The trained model demonstrates a 94.44% classification accuracy in the testing dataset.

The injection is done at the beginning of a simulation by dynamically rewiring the involved netlists. During the simulation on a realtime platform, faults can be activated or deactivated triggered by sequences, statistical effects or by events from the real world. In some cases the fault structures can even be auto-generated directly from a formal specification, which further automates the development process for safety-relevant systems. The approach is demonstrated at a SystemC/ SystemC AMS virtual prototype of a safety-critical sub-systems which runs on a dSPACE real-time hardware.",Digital Twin | Fault injection | HiL | Safety Critical Systems | SystemC | Validation | Verification,"Proceedings -Design, Automation and Test in Europe, DATE",2021-02-01,Conference Paper,"Markwirth, Thomas;Jancke, Roland;Sohrmann, Christoph",Include,

For well over a decade now, a frequency domain mode filtering based measurement technique has been utilized to significantly reduce range reflections within antenna test systems [1], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. More recently however, this technique has been adapted so that it could also be used with far-field and compact antenna measurement systems [9], [10], [1] with the technique being firmly rooted in conventional cylindrical near-field theory [1]. Although this family of techniques was initially intended to provide a means by which the lower frequency limit of operation of a given facility [3], [4] could be extended downwards to work effectively in applications where the operation would otherwise be impaired by the fixed physical size of the absorber and therefore predetermined electrical performance, these techniques have more recently been used very successfully to improve performance at the upper end of the frequency extent [11]. Although this technique has been extensively examined and verified empirically by means of range measurements, relatively little verification by means of computational electromagnetic simulation is available in the open literature [1], [12], [13], [14], [15]. In this paper, we developed an efficient computational electromagnetic (CEM) model of the measurement configuration, i.e. a digital twin, using a three-dimensional, full-wave CEM solver. The purpose of this is to construct an absolute truth-model to provide a firm basis for a detailed quantitative examination of the scattering suppression technique. The modelling technique is discussed in detail and initial results are presented which show very good agreement between the 'true' far-field pattern of the antenna in free space and that of the far-field of the antenna when perturbed with the presence of a scatterer and applying the scattering suppression process.",antenna | computational electromagnetic simulation | measurement | multipath suppression | propagation,"13th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation, EuCAP 2019",2019-03-01,Conference Paper,"Tian, Zhengrong;Gregson, Stuart",Exclude,

The system, broadly, consists of two parts: 1) a Hall-effect-based sensor module (SM) consisting of a twin eccentric-disc rotating arrangement and 2) a linearizing digital converter (LDC), which acts as an efficient interface for the transducer part. The SM provides cubic-natured push-pull outputs with respect to the angle. The linearizer further accepts these signals, performs a voltage-to-frequency transformation, and then applies novel linearization function to render a linear direct-digital indication of the angle. The article discusses the design and theoretical modeling of the SM, and its characteristics are derived. The sensor characteristics observed from simulation are in agreement with theoretical studies. Simulations are also extended to study the effect of important mechanical/magnetic parameters of the SM. Optimal parameter values are also inferred from these studies. The LDC and associated methodologies are also studied and presented in the article. The performance of the instrumentation system is validated using a hardware model of the SM and a prototype of the LDC. The experimental results show that the sensor and linearizer work as expected. Interfacing tests show that the overall instrumentation system gives an accuracy of less than 0.4% and a resolution of 0.2° over a wide range.",Angle sensor | direct-digital converter | eccentricity | finite-element (FE) analysis (FEA) | Hall effect | linearization | through-shaft positioning | voltage-to-frequency converter (VFC),IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,2020-05-01,Article,"Sontakke, British Ashok;Anoop, Chandrika Sreekantan;Kumar, Rahul;Ramesh, Jishnu Vellimana",Exclude,

Under this approach, a digital twin (DT) of a power converter is defined as a real-time, probabilistic simulation model with stochastic (random) variables, developed using generalized polynomial chaos expansion. The DT models are partitioned in perspective of control layers for power converter subsystems in the approach, with emphasis on the application and converter control layers. Real-time executed solvers of these divided probabilistic DT models are embedded into power converter controllers running on field programmable gate array (FPGA) computing devices. Using a monitoring system, the real-time probabilistic DTs at each control layer and the corresponding physical twins of the power converter are compared by the controllers to determine if the power converter is operating within probable behavior. Knowing the large computational cost of probabilistic modeling, the resource usage and timing of real-time DT solvers on modern FPGAs is reported for common power electronic converter topologies, showing the approach is feasible and able to perform probabilistic real-time simulation of smaller power converters in perspective of application and converter control layers using \leq 2\; \mu s time steps, with as low as \text{70}\;{\rm ns} steps; while staying embeddable within FPGA-based controllers. To highlight the capabilities of the proposed approach, a case study is presented using a probabilistic DT in the application layer controller of a pair of converters to comparatively monitor their behavior and corresponding controller action under hardware-in-the-loop testing.",Diagnostics | Digital twin (DT) | Polynomial chaos | Power electronics | Power system simulation | Probabilistic logic | Real-time systems,IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics,2020-09-01,Article,"Milton, Matthew;De La, Castulo O.;Ginn, Herbert L.;Benigni, Andrea",Include,

Many constraints prevent the application of iterative, incremental, and agile development methodologies, which now are the norm for many other fields of software. Time-consuming system validation can only start when both hardware and software components are ready, which implies that the software delivery and quality is almost always the final bottleneck in the CPS development and integration. Also organizational issues raise concerns-CPS development teams are nowadays often geographically distributed, which can result in delays in the process, shortcomings, and even mistakes.

When the replacement components differ from those that were designed at the system creation stage, the upgrade task arises. System upgrades require a complete cycle of work on validating both the replaceable components and the changed system itself. The system itself, if it is included in the life cycle of an existing industrial object, actually cannot be used as a testbed of the new components; generally, full-size system layouts are used for the testbed, and the complexity of those layouts may be comparable to the system itself. The inclusion of the digital twin in the life cycle of the object and its control system allows to effectively solve the problem of system modification (individual components replacement) in this case. The digital twin is not only a cheaper analog of the system that can be used for testing; due to the properties that allow parallel testing for several copies and to influence the model time within certain limits, it provides a higher quality of testing.",control system | digital twin | modernization | testing | upgrade | validation,"Proceedings - 2021 International Russian Automation Conference, RusAutoCon 2021",2021-09-05,Conference Paper,"Poletikin, Alexy;Promyslov, Vitaly;Semenkov, Kirill",Include,

Thus, it is important to detect such anomalies. Detecting such anomalies is challenging since it is uncertain when and where anomalies can happen. To this end, we present a novel approach called Anomaly deTection with digiTAl twIN (ATTAIN), which continuously and automatically builds a digital twin with live data obtained from a CPS for anomaly detection. ATTAIN builds a Timed Automaton Machine (TAM) as the digital representation of the CPS, and implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to detect anomalies. GAN uses a GCN-LSTM-based module as a generator, which can capture temporal and spatial characteristics of the input data and learn to produce realistic unlabeled adversarial samples. TAM labels these adversarial samples, which are then fed into a discriminator along with real labeled samples. After training, the discriminator is capable of distinguishing anomalous data from normal data with a high F1 score. To evaluate our approach, we used three publicly available datasets collected from three CPS testbeds. Evaluation results show that ATTAIN improved the performance of two state-of-art anomaly detection methods by 2.413%, 8.487%, and 5.438% on average on the three datasets, respectively.

Although many developed methods have greatly reduced the effects of a cyber-attack on the vulnerabilities of grid-connected devices, discovering new vulnerabilities is inevitable and a constant threat. As a result, the overall reliability and security of network communications with regard to grid-connected devices is a concern. This paper proposes a method that further secures a system by focusing on the control and hardware layer of grid-connected devices. The device’s controller firmware will be validated and authenticated using integrated device emulation resources prior to being activated to control the grid-connected device.

This paper presents a custom-designed coprocessor for output probability calculation (OPC), which is the most computation-intensive processing step in continuous hidden Markov model (CHMM)-based speech recognition algorithms. To save hardware resource and reduce power consumption, a polynomial addition-based method is used to compute add-log instead of the traditional look-up table-based method. In addition, the optimal tradeoff between speech processing delay, energy consumption, and hardware resources is explored for the coprocessor. The proposed coprocessor has been implemented and tested in Xilinx Spartan-3A DSP XC3SD3400A, and also validated using the standard-cell-based approach in IBM μm technology. To implement an entire speech recognition system, SAMSUNG S3C44b0X (containing an ARM7) is used as the micro-controller to execute the rest of speech processing. Tested with a 358-state 3-mixture 27-feature 800-word HMM, S3C44b0X operates at 40 MHz and coprocessor at 10 MHz to meet the real-time requirement, and the recognition accuracy is 95.2%. Power consumption of the micro-controller is 10 mW, and that of the coprocessor 15.2 mW. The overall speech recognition system achieves the lowest energy consumption per word recognition among many reported designs. Experiment and analysis show that the speech recognition system based on the proposed coprocessor is especially suitable for mid-size vocabulary (1001000 words) recognition tasks. © 2010 IEEE.",Coprocessor | custom design | field-programmable gate array (FPGA) | hardware implementation | hidden Markov model (HMM) | speech recognition | VLSI,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers,2011-01-01,Article,"Li, Peng;Tang, Hua",Exclude,

In this work, this disadvantage is eliminated by completely avoiding additional hardware. Instead, software-based methods from the field of machine learning are used. Therefore, measurement signals and control output variables are utilized, which are acquired and processed in any power electronic system for the purpose of converter control. The publication focuses on two main converter components: power semiconductors and dc-link capacitor. For each component, the aging mechanisms that have been studied in the literature are explained. Based on the aging mechanisms, the degradation indicators are identified. Then, a converter model is built that allows the variation of degradation indicators in order to analyze their effects on the available dataset. These findings form the basis for mathematical models, which detects future failure mechanisms of this type during converter operation. The test setup must offer the possibility of generating reproducible failure cases in various components with the aid of additional failure equipment.

However, the limited wireless resource and security concerns impede the deployment of the digital twin in IoT. In this article, we exploit blockchain to propose a new digital twin edge networks framework for enabling flexible and secure digital twin construction. We first develop cooperative federated learning through an access point (AP) to help resource-limited smart devices in constructing digital twin at the network edges belonging to different mobile network operators (MNOs). Then, we propose a model update chain by leveraging directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain to secure both local model updates and global model updates. In order to incentivize the APs to help in local models training for resource-limited smart devices and also encourage the APs to contribute resource in local model update verification, we design an iterative double auction-based joint cooperative federated learning and local model update verification scheme. The optimal unified time for cooperative federated learning and local model update verification is solved to maximize social welfare.

Traditional data-based fault diagnosis methods mostly assume that the training data and test data are following the same distribution and can acquire sufficient data to train a reliable diagnosis model, which is unrealistic in the dynamic changing production process. In this paper, we present a two-phase digital-twin-assisted fault diagnosis method using deep transfer learning (DFDD), which realizes fault diagnosis both in the development and maintenance phases. At first, the potential problems that are not considered at design time can be discovered through front running the ultra-high-fidelity model in the virtual space, while a deep neural network (DNN)-based diagnosis model will be fully trained. In the second phase, the previously trained diagnosis model can be migrated from the virtual space to physical space using deep transfer learning for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance. This ensures the accuracy of the diagnosis as well as avoids wasting time and knowledge. A case study about fault diagnosis using DFDD in a car body-side production line is presented.

The surrogate-assisted strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SSPEA) is developed to optimize the power-split control parameters guided by the data from the physical PHEV and its digital twins (DTs). By introducing a 'confidence factor,' the SSPEA uses the fused data of physically measured and virtually simulated vehicle performances (energy consumption and remaining battery state of charge) to converge the optimization process. Gaussian noisy models are adopted to emulate the real vehicle system on the hardware-in-the-loop platform for experimental evaluation. The testing results suggest that the proposed SSPEA requires less R&D costs than the model-free method that only uses the physical information, and more than 44.6% energy can be saved during the R&D process. Driven by the SSPEA, the optimized energy management system surpasses other non-DT-assisted systems by saving more than 4.8% energy.",Cyber-physical optimization | Digital twin (DT) | Noisy system | Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle | Surrogate-assisted strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SSPEA),IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,2022-06-01,Article,"Li, Ji;Zhou, Quan;Williams, Huw;Xu, Hongming;Du, Changqing",Exclude,

However, in practice, the different assets that make up ME-CPS are operated by independent entities with different objectives and perspectives in mind. A new methodology is introduced that puts the stakeholders at the center of the design process by assuming that the system will be correctly designed and operated if all stakeholders reach a common agreement using formal contracts, which can be simulated for verification and validation before signature. Models are used to structure the relationships between stakeholders at all stages of the systems lifecycle: formal contracts are derived from high-level goals and are verified using 'digital twins' that include requirement models and behavioral models.

State synchronization, as the main influencer of real-time interaction in a parallel system, determines the testing accuracy and computational efficiency. Despite the fact that the synchronization control is already a well-explored field, the traffic state synchronization in the application of the vehicle testing via virtual-real interaction is still a topic for further research. In this paper, to achieve better synchronization, a path generation method based on the Frenet frame is firstly designed to decompose the object's motion into the longitudinal and lateral directions, and achieves the trajectory tracking based on the near real-time data sent from the physical space. Then to eliminate the stochastic latency, the advance estimate-based path modification method is proposed to generate a stretch of path in advance. Finally, the integrated approach is implemented in a testing platform and the experimental results prove that the proposed method improves the synchronous rate by an average of 78.4% and 63.7% in the scenario of straight driving and lane changing.",,"2020 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, ITSC 2020",2020-09-20,Conference Paper,"Qiu, Weizhi;Shangguan, Wei;Cai, Baigen;Chai, Linguo;Chen, Junjie",Include,

Particularly, the malicious behavior requires a more accurate attention. This paper discusses the challenges related to the evaluation of software smart agents and proposes a first solution leveraging the monitoring facilities for a) assuring conformity between the software agent and its digital twin in a real-Time evaluation and b) validating decisions of the digital twins during runtime in a predictive simulation.",Digital Twins | Malicious Behaviours | Monitoring | Smart Ecosystems | Virtual Evaluation,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering Workshops, ISSREW 2019",2019-10-01,Conference Paper,"Cioroaica, Emilia;Di Giandomenico, Felicita;Kuhn, Thomas;Lonetti, Francesca;Marchetti, Eda;Jahic, Jasmin;Schnicke, Frank",Include,

However, there is a lack of efficient strategies and comprehensive approaches for managing assets and their associated data that can help to monitor, detect, record, and communicate operation and maintenance (O&M) issues. With the importance of Digital Twin (DT) concepts being proven in the architecture, engineering, construction and facility management (AEC/FM) sectors, a DT-enabled anomaly detection system for asset monitoring and its data integration method based on extended industry foundation classes (IFC) in daily O&M management are provided in this study. This paper presents a novel IFC-based data structure, using which a set of monitoring data that carries diagnostic information on the operational condition of assets is extracted from building DTs. Considering that assets run under changing loads determined by human demands, a Bayesian change point detection methodology that handles the contextual features of operational data is adopted to identify and filter contextual anomalies through cross-referencing with external operation information. Using the centrifugal pumps in the heating, ventilation and air-cooling (HVAC) system as a case study, the results indicate and prove that the novel DT-based anomaly detection process flow realizes a continuous anomaly detection of pumps, which contributes to efficient and automated asset monitoring in O&M.",Anomaly detection | Digital twin | Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) | Operation and Maintenance management,Automation in Construction,2020-10-01,Article,"Lu, Qiuchen;Xie, Xiang;Parlikad, Ajith Kumar;Schooling, Jennifer Mary",Include,
